            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HAving an Orphan, or Poſthumus in my protection, and being ſollicited by divers for the propagation of the publick good in its Publication; for its better enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, I appeare to tell the World it is a Legitimate Childe of Mr. <hi>Nicholas Culpeper,</hi> my deceaſed Husband. And as I promiſe you it is the Genuine and Ingenious Off-ſpring of his Brain, ſo I queſtion not, it will (with the reſt of his laborious Pieces) help to blow louder the Trumpet of his never dying Fame. I need not much endeavoar to atteſt that this Tractate is his; for it will evidently appear at firſt ſight, that it is the Childe of ſuch a Father; which will be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation enough both for the one and the other: and that is the reaſon I refuſed to ſeek a Patron for it, ſince I know his bare
<pb facs="tcp:51945:4"/> Name will ſufficiently ſerve for a Patronage. I follow the new Mode of the Times, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowing of Godfathers; yet the Bookſeller thought it inconvenient, that this Treatiſe ſhould wander up and down the World with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Name, and therefore it is Chriſtned, <hi>The School of Phyſick.</hi> If it ſhall pleaſe any one to caſt their affections on this Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Childe, him ſhall I eſteem as my Goſsip. Expect from me to ſay no more at preſent, becauſe I would willingly croſs an old Saying, Women are never ſilent till dead. I am in in all vertuous Endeavours for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Good,</p>

               <hi>The Preface.</hi> To all Students in Phyſick, Chyrurgery, and Chymeſtry.</head>
            <p>THough that thoſe which look for an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life ſet but light by a temporary, as they are truly ſenſible here below, to meet with a maſs and accumulation of ſins and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows; nevertheleſs ſince we finde long life to be one of thoſe bleſſings ſo often promiſed in the old Law, as alſo that the beloved Diſciple of our bleſſed Saviour ſurvived the other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and many of the Fathers of the Church were long lived; we Mortals, as we are too prone on Earth to eſteem it our chiefeſt good, cannot at leaſt but enroll it amongſt others of the choice and great favours we receive from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. The old ſaying is, <hi>Vita brevis, Ars longa;</hi> Life is ſhort, and Art is long: therefore in all ages it hath been the ambitious task of Learned men, if it were poſſible, to perfect Art, ſo as to prolong life, even to the length of dayes: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the beſt of them found there inquiries too difficult, ſome of them having carefully ſcrutini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed and ſearcht the matter of the reparation, but none yet living ever attained to the manner; it being an agreed of Truth, that in the declining of age, there is an unequal reparation, ſome parts are repaired eaſily, ſome with difficulty and loſs: the Spirits, Blood, Fleſh, and Fat, are even
<pb facs="tcp:51945:5"/> after the declining of years eaſily repaired, but the drier and more poreous parts, the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, all the Tunicles, Sinnews, Arteries, Veins, Bones, Cartilages, moſt of the Bowels, in a word, all the organical parts are hardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairable, and to their loſs. Now theſe hardly repairable parts, to uſe the ſame words of one of the Moderns, a moſt eminent Writer of this nation, that when the Phyſician comes to the office of repairing of them, the other which are eaſily repaired, finding themſelves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of their wonted ability and ſtrength, ceaſe longer to perform their proper function; by which means it comes to paſs, that in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of time, the whole body tends to ruine. Though theſe conſiderations are thus premiſed, that in ſpight of Art, Death and a Diſſolution at laſt will come; nevertheleſs it ought to be the care of every wiſe and honeſt Phyſician, that ſince nature may in part be repaired, that life may be nouriſht, that the length of it is one of the greateſt bleſſings on earth, ſo for him to ſhow his Chriſtian Charity, moſt religiouſly to obſerve and endeavour, to the extent of his skill, what may be by him performed, as to this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longation: it being the duty of one that knows the wayes of nature, as how to turn her about, ſo alſo whilſt life can be preſerved, to maintain her in her moſt healthful dimenſions. Nor do I eſteem of a Phyſician for his onely knowing how to act, as to a nouriſhing renovation, reſtoring, and continuance of health, but it will be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enjoyned on his conſcience, to mitigate
<pb facs="tcp:51945:5"/> the far diſtance of a Doctor, with ſuch whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome inſtructions been able to diſcern, if not to have determined, of the parts affected, the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the ſigns, and ſymptomes of a Diſeaſe; how to have applied right Medicines either for the quantity or quality, for the curing of themſelves or others; ſuch as in caſes of neceſſity they needed not to have ſent ſome miles for, but might have found in the Fields, or in their neighbouring Gardens; whereas for want of the aſſiſtance of a true Method of Phyſick, this knowledge having been denied them, thouſands have periſht, as at the great day of account ſome will finde to be too true. I appeal to all men in their Wits, whether there are ſuch unnatural Monopolizers in the World? What Nation is there, that their Phyſicians have not for the moſt part at the firſt writ in their Mother tongue? I have been informed that the late Famous Mr. <hi>Noy</hi> of <hi>Lincolns Inne,</hi> that he would have had the Gentlemen to have joyned with him, and moved to have the Law turned into Engliſh, which they being averſe to, though otherwiſe he promiſed to remember the Society in his Will; inſtead of a Library, which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended when he died, he left them nothing but the Comedy of <hi>Ignoramus,</hi> which hangs up; and as I am certified, is there ſtill to be ſeen. I have read that the German Phyſicians once a year in their Mother Tongue regeſtred their Cures in the temple of <hi>Aeſculapius,</hi> whereby the common ſort of people knew how to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference diſeaſes; could diſtinguiſh of the eaſie
<pb facs="tcp:51945:6"/> from the more difficult cures, and learnt accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the light then derived to them, to preſerve themſelves and others; whereas we have reaſon to thank our grave, wiſe, and learned Phyſicians over the left ſhoulder, who would have us know nothing, or as little as may be. Mr. <hi>Culpeper,</hi> now in Heaven, ſpent himſelf early and late for the good of his Countrey-men; he diſcovered their Subtilties, and was one of the firſt that broke down the partition-wall of our ignorance and ſlavery; they are his own words. <hi>I have already made a progreſs, and whileſt I am in the Land of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> Living, I will perſiſt, in ſpight of all oppoſers, to inform my Countrey-men.</hi> It was his greateſt ambition to do all the good he could on earth, the Lord having anſwered his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, though himſelf did not live to ſee it, in the publiſhing of this <hi>Volume,</hi> which may truly be called <hi>a School of Phyſick,</hi> even a <hi>Grammar</hi> to learn all the <hi>Rudiments</hi> of the compleat <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi> of this <hi>Art;</hi> ſo that if the peruſer of this Work be but one of good natural parts, though he be ignorant of the <hi>Tongues,</hi> he ſhall on ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent grounds be able to give a reaſonable anſwer, ſo as to reſolve the moſt uſeful and conſiderable queſtions in <hi>Phyſick,</hi> that can be propounded to him; he ſhall be ſo informed to give an account of what of himſelf he ſhall undertake to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe. It will be needleſs to enlarge my ſelf fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, this Book hath worth enough in it to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare its Author; it requires no commendation to fore-run it; <hi>Diet, Reaſon,</hi> and <hi>Experience,</hi> the three Doctors Mr. <hi>Culpeper</hi> conſulted with, built
<pb facs="tcp:51945:6"/> upon good principles, ſo that the Student ſhall finde both the <hi>Theorick</hi> and the <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick</hi> ſweetly to agree in the diſcovery of the moſt concealed truths. This method of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice being experienced by himſelf, written in the intervals of his lingring ſickneſs; as he had a long time before his death bid adieu to all worldly reſpects, he having, as hath been ſaid, no higher aim, then the healths and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of his Countrey-men; he left, as I may preſume from my own knowledge to affirm, in the hands of his beſt friends, to this very purpoſe, all his tried Receipts in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to be printed; as beſides thoſe names thou readeſt affixed to this work, there are many others, if there were occaſion, are ready to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie. I am confident no private man in any age could ſhow ſuch a volume, compiled of ſuch experimental probations; the Author never ſhowing himſelf ſo clearly and powerfully in any of his printed Treatiſes as in this laſt, having been heard to ſay, that in publiſhing ſome of his former tranſlations, he was troubled with the epidemical diſeaſe, as 'tis uſual with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of ſuch worth; he then entertained, as he acknowledged, an ambition to be known to the world; but in theſe his Treatiſes, as he proteſted, he had opened his breaſt, dealt ſo ingeniouſly for the good of the publick, as to diſcover the myſtery of his profeſſion, not reſerving a ſecret he knew, that might keep men alive, or when they were in danger, that might recover them, this beeing the ſtore-houſe of <hi>his whole Practice.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:51945:7"/>
            <p>Loving Countrey-men, whatſoever benefit you ſhall reap by the labours of our deceaſed friend, let your Chriſtian charity employ it for the good of your neighbours; thanks be to God, there are ſtill noble perſons left, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch bleſſed occaſions of being aiding to others, are ready to expoſe their perſons and purſes, not being aſhamed, as ſome are, but accounting it their honour to be helpful to the poor; to ſuch Worthies this volume will be moſt acceptable, not onely as it will increaſe, but alſo confirm their knowledge. It will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo extreamly neceſſary for thoſe of lower <hi>Formes</hi> in the <hi>School of Phyſick;</hi> young <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitioners,</hi> who may in this lively mirror ſee their miſtakes, and the deformities of their <hi>Practice,</hi> how they have cauſed the <hi>Medicines</hi> they formerly applied, not onely to be ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, but rather deſtructive to the healths of their <hi>Patients;</hi> as they are to ask God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs for their ignorance, in placing the Cart before the Horſe, the <hi>Practick</hi> before the <hi>Theorick,</hi> their ventring hand over head on the Medicine, before they rightly knew the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, like the mad Empericks of theſe times, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident in undertaking cures, though they erre both in the method and rules, that ought ſtep by ſtep to be trod in and purſued. In this <hi>School of Phyſick,</hi> ſuch too forward dangerous Practitioners, whatſoever arrogantly they have hitherto aſſumed to themſelves, they are to meet with other diſcipline, ſure to be put back and taught a new leſſon; firſt, rightly to know
<pb facs="tcp:51945:7"/> the dolors and torments of diſeaſes; for him, like the good <hi>Samaritan,</hi> to pour in the Oyl of his compaſſion, as much as in him lies, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate the preſent miſeries of the Patient, that he may for the preſent finde ſome comfort, till God in his mercy vouchſafes to ſhow better Symptomes of his recovery: and when he hath ſo given him over, that all hopes of life are paſt, ſtill to remain conſtant to his undertakings, like honeſt Mr. <hi>Culpeper,</hi> who would not leave or forſake his patient when he perceived death, till he had procured and opened a fair and eaſie paſſage for him to go out of this life. As for thoſe ſtately Doctors that ſcruple at attendance after they have received their large Fees, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending other diſpatches, they will not ſtay with their languiſhing Chriſtian brother; what can this neglect of theirs be imputed ſo much to, as the cruelty of their exceſſive pride, for otherwiſe, if they were not wanting to their profeſſion, and to humanity it ſelf, they might in the time of their ſtaying give ſuch advice as to facilitate the pains of death, comfort the ſpirits of the afflicted perſon, ſo far as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten his minde for the making of his peace with Heaven, and his more orderly taking of his leave of his affairs on earth. The Phyſician alſo might better his skill, ſo far as to obſerve the conflicts of the ſeveral diſtempers in the iſſues of death, ſo as to diſtinguiſh of the vigors and workings of all manner of Diſeaſes in their laſt &amp; ſaddeſt triumphs. Phyſicians in other parts of the world do not come ſo eaſily by their money,
<pb facs="tcp:51945:8"/> they have ſet, ſtinted, ſmall fees appointed them, ſo ordened of purpoſe, that they might be made more diligent; that if their Chriſtian Charity did not, their neceſſities might compel them to come the oftner to make up their Summe; ſo that the poor for a ſmall pittance are better at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, then our rich perſons are here for their handfuls of Gold. The truth is, throughout the whole World there are not ſuch ſlaves to the Doctors, as the poor Engliſh are; moſt of them profeſs themſelves Proteſtants, but their practices have been like thoſe of the Papiſts, to hide the grounds of Phyſick from the vulgar, who for want of a right knowledge of the true courſe and rules of this Art, having no eſtates to pour into their bottomleſs Purſes: <hi>Si nihil attuleris, ibis Homere foras,</hi> No Money, no Doctor. The poor ſouls in their diſſerted and extream neceſſities having been forced (as they were alwayes kept in a deſperate ignorance) to take ſuch unnatural and monſtrous Phyſick, as to be their own mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers; whereas if they had not been hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winkt, and muffled in ſuch darkneſs, ſacrificed to the ambitions and covetouſneſs of ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable perſons, the poor wretches might by the conſcientious aids of worthy Writers in their mother tongue, (I do not mean ſuch Engliſh mad hodge-podge dangerous Books, as we have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy too many of in Print) but of learned, adviſed, methodical, and uſeful Authors in our Language, from which they might have been ſo taught and directed, as to know how to diſtinguiſh of the moſt uſual Diſeaſes of themſelves, in caſe of
<pb facs="tcp:51945:8"/> the diſeaſe before they go about the cure; and then to compound the Medicine ſo, as to relate to the nature of the Patients body; otherwiſe that which may cure one might kill another. They being thus once put into the right way to diſcern and determine of the moſt uſual Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, throughout this book, with Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, they ſhall meet with perfect directions for the cures; the truth is, amongſt a few good, there are abundance of Authors of other Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, whoſe works, with whatſoever hard words they amaze their Readers, do the leſs concerne us, as their Medicines do more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly agree with the conſtitutions of the bodies of their own Countreys. The volumes of theſe forreign Doctors in the practical part of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, do ſo ſwell to no purpoſe, with ſuch infinite variety of medicaments, that the practitioners are confounded, as not knowing amongſt ſo many which of them to chooſe. Mr. <hi>Culpeper</hi> being truly ſenſible of this their error, made it his buſineſs not to puzzle his young Students with the multiplicity of Medicines, but onely to ſelect and ſet down ſuch as are moſt proper, choice, and effectual againſt the diſeaſe, ſuch as are generally eſteemed, and frequently uſed, the moſt magiſterial Receits. To be brief, this work may be compared to the Rainbows diverſity of colours, in reſpect of the variety of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes it conſiſts of, which cannot but render it the more acceptable to the people of the three Nations, as in ſo ſmall a volume they have the whole body of Phyſick, which before in reſpect
<pb facs="tcp:51945:9"/> of the largeneſs of the ſize, was of ſuch a price that the meaner ſort of people were not able to purchaſe it; this work in the Abſtract and Epitome comprehending whatſoever of any concernment hath formerly been printed; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo intire and beholding onely to it ſelf, as to be free from whatſoever tautologies, impertin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, vain and frivolous repetitions, thoſe larger Authors, to no purpoſe, have puzzled their Readers with; this work being of purpoſe contrived to ſave the charges of larger vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes; to uſe the Authors own words, <hi>It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> Homers Illiads <hi>in a Nut-ſhel;</hi> his honeſt intention being for the future to prevent thoſe already mentioned inconveniences, which the poor have ſo long ſuffered under; that with the uſe of this book, and on occaſion, their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther recourſe to the <hi>Doctors Diſpenſatory,</hi> if they are at too great a diſtance from a chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and deſerving <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> upon ſuddain emergencies of neceſſity, they might be ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily furniſht, as to help themſelves, or be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtant to others. To conclude, Courteous Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, I ſhall in the fear of God requeſt thee to make an honeſt uſe of theſe endeavours, to be careful, dilgent, and underſtanding in what thou undertakeſt; and in all thy undertakings to crave a bleſſing from heaven, never failing to return hearty thanks to the Lord for what good ſoever thou receiveſt. For my own part, I deſire not to be known, I am ſufficiently concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the applauſe of my own conſcience; I look not on any worldly repute to my ſelf, but
<pb facs="tcp:51945:9"/> to the good of thouſands of generations that ſhall follow: It is enough for me, that in the publiſhing of this Work, I have with ſincerity and truth diſcharged the truſt impoſed in me, by our deceaſed friend. Farewell, read, and enjoy.</p>

               </p>
               <p>He was indeed of ſuch a temperature, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred to have heard him confeſs, that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly was an extraordinary enemy unto
<pb facs="tcp:51945:12"/> him; ſo great at ſometimes, that wanting company he would ſeem like a dead man; and at other times would his Choller macerate him very ſtrangely, yea, more oft then the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Melancholly.</p>

                  <hi>Mercury</hi> the Patron of ingenuity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is the moſt potent Planet in the Figure, and he being in ♏ the houſe of ♂ and ſo near the Benigne Beams of ♀, argued the Native to be of an excellent wit, ſharp fancy, admirable concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and of an active underſtanding.</p>
               <p>For proof of this, let his many worthy Works now extant be ſummon'd to give in evidence, <hi>viz</hi> (1.) His tranſlation of the Diſpenſatory, ſo exquiſitely done. (2.) His Engliſh Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian; a work of ſuch rarety, that never any Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bariſt before him durſt adventure to do. (3.) His Aſtrological judgement of Diſeaſes from <hi>Avenezra</hi> and <hi>Durret,</hi> in which he hath ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniouſly followed the text of his Authors, that if any copies may be preſumed or thought to improve, or excel their originalls, this very book of his doth ſo. And beſides theſe, he hath publiſhed divers others, as his laſt Legacy, of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable worth, truly his own.</p>
               <p>He was very eloquent, a good Orator, ſpoke both freely and fluently. And if I ſhall ſpeak the truth in all parts, he was very conceited and full of jeaſts, as the <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g> of ♂ and ☿ aptly denotes; but the knack of jeaſting was ſo inſeparable to him, that in his writing things of moſt ſerious concernment, he would mingle matters of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and extreamly pleaſe himſelf in ſo doing,
<pb facs="tcp:51945:12"/> as is evident in all his writings; but the Poets excuſe is ſufficient.</p>

               <p>The Lord of the ſecond is Retrograde upon the Cuſpe of the fourth in <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g> to the ſecond houſe, and ♀ his diſpoſitrix combuſt in <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g> of ♂, and in <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g> to the ſecond alſo, which plainly portends a conſumption of Riches, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of what patrimony ſhould deſcend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him from his Parents. And ♂ afflicting ☿ <hi>pars fortunae,</hi> in an obſcure houſe of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and ☉ Lord thereof in ☍ of ♄, cauſed him to ſquander away his eſtate both careleſly and negligently, and ſometimes by reaſon of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint or impriſonment.</p>
               <p>It is moſt true, that he was alwayes ſubject to a Conſumption of the Purſe, notwithſtanding the many wayes he had to aſſiſt him. His Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony was alſo chiefly conſumed at the Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Indeed he had a ſpirit ſo far above the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
<pb facs="tcp:51945:13"/> that he contemned and ſcorned riches, any other way, then to make them ſerviceable to him; he was as free of his Purſe as his Pen; valued not how little he left himſelf of either, ſo he obtained his end of doing good to others. I could parallel this his Generoſity with Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the ſame ſtamp, from ſome Genitures very eminent, but I am confined. I ſhall cloſe my diſcourſe of his eſtate with this — Had not he had <hi>Caput Draconis</hi> in the ſecond, he would have been perpetually poor: for the arguments of Poverty in his Radix are ſuch, that had he been born to <hi>Craeſus</hi> eſtate, it would have plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him better to have exchanged it for that of <hi>Diogenes.</hi>
               </p>

Beſides ♈ being on the third, and ♂ in a ſterril Sign, portends very few, or no Brethren or Siſters to the Native; and in this caſe the fewer the better.</p>
               <p>It would be too tedious to make repetition of the many misfortunes this Native hath ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by his Kindred, and the perils and dangers he hath eſcaped in travelling or going ſhort
<pb facs="tcp:51945:13"/> Journeys. It is confirming enough of the Art, that he never gained good by either. Nor had he ever any Brethren, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>Saturn</hi> the general ſignificator of Fathers,<note place="margin">Parents, &amp;c.</note> and <hi>Venus</hi> the particular in this Nativity, are in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and ♂ the Lord of the tenth in <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g> to both, and that from fixed ſigns, together with <hi>Venus</hi> her being combuſt, all which clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note, that the Parents of this Native ſhall die before him: but had they lived, I cannot ſee in Art how he ſhould have been bettered by them, their ſignificators are ſo ſquaring and oppoſing his. He hath often averred, that his Father, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to report, dyed before he was born, and his Mother lived till the twenty third year of his age; and he acknowledged alſo that they did leave him well, but he was cheated thereof, or at leaſt ſpent the greateſt part of it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Venus</hi> being Governeſs of the fifth Houſe, and in ♏ a fruitful Sign, irradiating both the Aſcendant and Seventh, friendly ſignifies that the Native may have many Children; but <hi>Caput Meduſae</hi> being upon the Cuſp of the fifth, and ♀ Combuſt, and in ☍ to ♄ that enemy to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and all natural exiſtencies, and in <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g> of ♂
<pb facs="tcp:51945:14"/> a Planet poſited in the Houſe of Death, preſages that very few of them (if any) ſhall be long lived.</p>
               <p>This Native had but one Wife, (<hi>viz.</hi> Mrs. <hi>Alice Culpeper</hi> now living) and by her he had ſeven Children, (although himſelf died young) but they are all dead but one, which is a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The world may judge how chargeable the management of ſuch tranſactions of his life were, he being a perſon ſo given up to his Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as never to take care for the future; his Wife, her induſtry being the beſt provider for his neceſſary affairs, which care of hers he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited in the admirable Secrets he left her.</p>
               <p>His Enemies both publique and private,<note place="margin">Enemies publique and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate.</note> are ſignified by ♃ and <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>, but principally ♃, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath great dignities both in the twelfth and ſeventh Houſes, ♂ alſo will have a ſhare in ſignification of his enemies, becauſe he is in <g ref="char:trine">△</g> of ♃, and ⚹ of <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>, and beholds the Lord of the Aſcendent with a <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g>. Now if the queſtion be demanded what kinde of perſons theſe Planets ſignifie, ♂ will ſignifie Phyſicians, Apothecaries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ♃ Divines. And thoſe two kindes of men and profeſſions ſhould be his moſt potent adverſaries, both publique and private, ♂ the moſt publique.</p>
               <p>It is notoriouſly known, that his moſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique enemies were Phyſicians, and his moſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ones Divines. The firſt hated him, and made their hatred publike, for his diſcovering the uſe of Medicine in his mother tongue. The ſecond did diſguſt him for his ſtudying Aſtrology, but neither of them durſt to enter the liſts of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
<pb facs="tcp:51945:14"/> with him, albeit, I remember he hath made publique challenges to ſome in Print, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to fault his doings. Whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that the Doctors queſtioned not, or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villed at the matter, but the manner of his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. They were not ſimply ſorry that ſuch things were done, but that he that did them was not one of the Colledge, a Brother of their Order. And the ſame may be ſaid of his other ſort of Enemies: but well ſaid <hi>Juvenal,</hi>

It is very well known that he gained his Honour by Arts and Sciences; but chiefly by Phyſick, in the knowledge of which he
<pb facs="tcp:51945:15"/> was moſt excellently skilled: and it was purely by that alone Study of Practice, that he hath left a name behinde him, which will remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til time ſhall be no longer.</p>

               <p>I have heard it credibly reported by ſome that were with him at the time of his death, and conſtantly in his ſickneſs, that he dyed of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption which had been long upon him; and much means, (and that of the better ſort) was uſed to enervate it, but it ſtill prevailed upon him, waſting and, conſuming him by degrees, until it reduced him to a very Sceleton, or Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy; and afterwards, <hi>viz.</hi> on Munday the tenth of <hi>January</hi> 1653/4 releaſed him, and gave him his paſport to a better world.

               <p>Nor was it truly reported, that ſome Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans deſigned his death, by ſetting their engines at work to poyſon, him. I do believe they were enemies great enough unto him; yet I am

            <head>The LIFE of the admired PHYSICIAN and ASTRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOGER of our Times, Mr. <hi>Nicholas Culpeper.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IN the County of <hi>Kent,</hi> a place eminently famous for Loyalty to Superiors, <hi>Nicholas Culpeper</hi> was born the eighteenth of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> 1616. he was the Son of <hi>Nicholas Culpeper,</hi> a Reverend Divine, ſon to Sir <hi>Thomas Culpeper</hi> Knight and Baronet; his Mother was the Daughter of Mr. <hi>William Atterſol</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Isfield</hi> in the County of <hi>Suſſex;</hi> this worthy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine did write that learned Comentary on the Book of <hi>Numbers,</hi> with other excellent Works. <hi>Ncholas Culpeper</hi> the younger was educated at a Free-ſchool in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> at the coſt and charges of his Mother, (for his Father died a moneth before he was born) he was a moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently pious Miniſter, and much reverenced for his vertuous Qualities by all that rightly knew him, who were truly afflicted that his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Father did not live to bring him up, ſince he left no other Children behinde him. After her Husbands deceaſe, Mrs. <hi>Culpeper</hi> his mother, took
<pb facs="tcp:51945:17"/> ſuch care for his education, that ſhe ſpent four hundred pounds on her ſaid Son, for his Diet, Schooling, and his being at the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where he continued ſome years, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited in all manner of Learning, and gained the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe of the Univerſity whilſt he remained there. One of the firſt Diverſions that he had amongſt ſome other ſmaller tranſactions and changes, none of his Life proving more unfortunate, was, that he had engaged himſelf in the Love of a Beautiful Lady; I ſhall not name her for ſome reaſons; her Father was reported to be one of the nobleſt and wealthieſt in <hi>Suſſex.</hi> This fair Lady after many generous treatments, as Mr. <hi>Culpeper</hi> might clearly perceive, entertained the Tenders of his ſervice, ſo far as to requite him with her entire and ſincere Affections; and though the ſtrictneſs of Parents have often too ſevere eyes over their Children, yet where hearts are once united, Lovers uſe to break through all difficulties. The riches of the Lady, (which might have enchanted inferior ſpirits) in reſpect of the vertuous inclinations of her Minde and Perſon, had no power over him, ſo that like a true Lover, the Language of his Eyes and his Heart were the ſame, inſomuch that the languiſhing ſincerities of theſe ſuffering Ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morato's, put them to the extremity of the determination, ſome way to ſet a period to their Martyrdomes. Mr. <hi>Culpeper</hi> having then ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied himſelf with two hundred pounds from his Mother, during his abode at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> his Fair Miſtreſs and he by Letters and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
<pb facs="tcp:51945:17"/> plotted ſecretly with the aſſiſtance of a Gentlewoman that waited on her, to pack up ſuch Rich Jewels, and other neceſſaries as might beſt appertain to a Journey, and ſo ſecretly to make their eſcape near to <hi>Lewis</hi> in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> where they intended to Marry; and afterwards for a ſeaſon to live privately till the incenſed Parents were pacified; but this happineſs was denied them by the Malevolence of <hi>Mars,</hi> and ſome other envious Planets, as you ſhall finde in his Nativity. Not to vex the expectation of the Reader any longer, but rather to epitomize ſo ſad a ſtory, Mr. <hi>Culpeper</hi> haſtes from <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> his Miſtreſs with thoſe that ſhe durſt truſt, were gone part of their way to meet him at the appointed place; but it pleaſed the great diſpoſer of terrene affairs to order it otherwiſe; the Lady and her ſervants being ſuddainly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized with a dreadful ſtorme, with fearful claps of Thunder, ſurrounded with flames of Fire and flaſhes of Lightning, with ſome of which Mr. <hi>Culpepers</hi> fair Miſtreſs was ſo ſtricken; that ſhe immediately fell down dead, exchanging of this life for a better; her Marriage on earth for one in heaven. When the Lady was ſtript, all the marks that could be found on her fair body, was onely a blue ſpot on her right ſide about the breadth of ones hand. The news of this ſad accident met Mr. <hi>Culpeper</hi> as he journ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards his dead to him, but otherwiſe a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> living Saint. At the inſtant when this direful <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> chance befell him, Sir <hi>Nicholas Aſtey</hi> his inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate acquaintance paſſing by, chanced to be an
<pb facs="tcp:51945:18"/> eye-witneſs of this ſad diſaſter, who uſed the beſt Rhetorick he had to comfort him in this his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction; he took him up in his Coach, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed him to his Mother, who not expecting then to have ſeen him, received him with a great deal of joy, till being ſo truly ſenſible of his ſorrows; ſhe for that cauſe left that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and afterwards fell into a fit of ſickneſs which ſhe was never rid of till her dying day.</p>
            <p>It is impoſſible to expreſs the ſorrow of ſo true a lover as Mr. <hi>Culpeper</hi> was, the ſtrangeneſs of this misfortune being enough to ſhake the ſtrongeſt reſolutions of the moſt eſtabliſht per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the world; I ſhall onely acquaint the Reader with what I have heard of his beſt friends, that when that he was ſerious even to entertain the deepeſt Melancholly that his frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty could ſuffer on earth, that then he would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe at large the ſad fate of his unfortunate Miſtriſs. This Lady on whom this unhappy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident fell, had two thouſand pounds in perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal eſtate, and five hundred pounds a year; the loſs of this Jewel which Mr. <hi>Culpeper</hi> valued above all worldly conſiderations, caſt him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſo deep a Melancholly, that he left the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of <hi>Cambridge;</hi> ſo that it was high time for his Grand-father Mr. <hi>William Atterſol</hi> whoſe care he was, to think of ſome ſeaſonable way to divert this his extraordinary diſtemper; and the rather, for that he perceived contrary to his intention, that Mr. <hi>Culpeper</hi> bent his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations from the time that he was but ten Years of Age, to thoſe as he conceived unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
<pb facs="tcp:51945:18"/> (if not unlawful ſtudies) of Aſtrology and occult Philoſophy, which how they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented ſtill by ſome Divines and other Zealous perſons, the world is too well acquainted. Mr. <hi>Atterſol</hi> had formerly uſed his beſt Arguments, though to no purpoſe to perſwade him to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Miniſterial function, with an intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as it was ſuppoſed after his Deceaſe to have ſetled his eſtate on him; which ſince he would not hearken too, he divided four hundred pounds a year amongſt the reſt of his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>children, and left him but a Legacy of forty ſhillings, which was paid him by the two Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors at <hi>Nathaniel Brook</hi> his ſhop at the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell in <hi>Cornhill.</hi> This ſmall ſumme he received with a ſmile, and ſaid, He had courted two Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes that had coſt him very dear, but it was not the wealth of Kingdoms ſhould buy them from him. The truth is, there are ſome <hi>Zealots</hi> that without any colour call Aſtrology it ſelf the Black Art, count all Circles above th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> Sphere to be conjuring, as Mr. <hi>Culpeper</hi> uſed to ſay, If ſuch kinde of people cannot flie up to Heaven to render Aſtrology a miracle, they will fetch it from Hell to make it Magick, though it may be well enough performed by natural cauſes. To proceed, Mr. <hi>Atterſol</hi> with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his friends, conſulted how to diſpoſe of Mr. <hi>Culpeper,</hi> which was to ſend him to <hi>London,</hi> where they placed him with Mr. <hi>White</hi> an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary near <hi>Temple Bar,</hi> to whom they gave with him fifty pounds; he having not been with him above a year and a half, Mr. <hi>White</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:51945:19"/> failed, his neceſſities compelling him to go into <hi>Ireland</hi> with the loſs of Mr. <hi>Culpepers</hi> money, which cauſed his friends afterwards to beſtow him with Mr. <hi>Drake</hi> an Apothecary in <hi>Thred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>needle-ſtreet,</hi> where being himſelf excellent in the Latine, he taught Mr. <hi>Drake</hi> that Tongue in leſs then a year and a half. Not long after this, his other friend dyed; he ſtill remained with Mr. <hi>Samuel Leadbeaters,</hi> who formerly lived with him; and afterwards took his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſhop within <hi>Biſhops-gate,</hi> where for ſome ſpace of time he ſtudied Phyſick. In which appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his, he ſhewed a great deal of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to chuſe a Profeſſion, according to his own diſpoſition, and inclination, the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Indenture to binde a man to the happineſs of a noble and ſucceſsful enterpriſe. Before I ſhall further diſcourſe his ſtory, it will not be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to acquaint the World with ſome obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, that thoſe that were moſt familiar with him intimated to me, (with ſome others that I gleaned from him) concerning his Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Practice; in his addreſſes to his Patients, he was not as ſome are, ſo arrogant to warrant their recovery: his uſual advice was to bid them truſt in God, and ſeek to him for a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. He was none of thoſe that uſed to put confidence in the ſingle teſtimony of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which as he uſed to ſay, <hi>Drawn from the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine, is as brittle as the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rinal;</hi> the Water running ſometimes in ſuch poſte haſte through the ſick mans body, that there is no account to be given of it, though the moſt judicious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb facs="tcp:51945:19"/> examine it; for the ſick man may be in the ſtate of death, though life appear in the Urinal. To the poor he preſcribed cheap, but whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Medicines; not removing, as many in our times do, the Conſumption out of their bodies into their purſes; not ſending them to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> for Drugs, when they may fetch better out of their own Gardens. Thoſe that knew him rightly affirm that he was ſo Charitable to his poor Countrey-men, that the money that he received from rich perſons, he ſpread upon the waters, laid it forth for the good of thoſe that were in want, though through his Charity he was ſometimes neceſſitated: he would not participate of any thing from the meaner ſort of people, he onely deſired their prayers. I have heard thoſe that rightly knew him ſay, that when he might have had a large ſumme to have gone to a rich perſon, he rather choſe to go to one of his poor neighbours that hath been ſick, where he hath given away his Phyſick; which ſome of his friends wondering at, he hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>As he was an Apothecary formerly himſelf, ſo he diſcerned the errours of Apothecaries, and was therefore an Apothecary to himſelf, and others. He uſed not to hanſel his experiments, letting looſe as ſome do their mad Receipts into ſick mens bodies, to try how well Nature can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb facs="tcp:51945:20"/> ſtand by and ſee the Battel, except it were in deſperate caſes, when death muſt be expelled; and when he could keep life no longer, he made an eaſie paſſage for it to go out, (as his Book of the Aſtrological judgement of Diſeaſes) where he unites Aſtrology to Phyſick, as they concerne the decumbiture of the ſick, doth ſufficiently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to the World; not like an Emprick, who being guilty neither of Greek, nor Latine, of writing well, or ſpelling true Engliſh, being asked why it was called a Hectique Feaver, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered becauſe of a Hecking Cough that attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the diſeaſe; yet this impoſture is an imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Aeſculapius,</hi> ſo as to tyranize over the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and bodies of thouſands, having as many fools to wait his leiſure, as the late learned <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nertus</hi> was reported to have had ſometimes two hundred Patients in a morning.

               </gap> freely expreſſed; one of them being diſpoſed to ſpeak truth of him, ſaid, <hi>That he was not onely for</hi> Gallen <hi>and</hi> Hypocrates, <hi>but he knew how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

<pb facs="tcp:51945:20"/> pleaſed to ſpend their verdicts either well or ill on him, ſo he hath not been much behinde hand with them. I have heard him ſay, that the Doctors were Learned, well furniſhed with ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral notions in Phyſick, but there were ſome tried Receipts in the hands of private perſons they could never arrive to; which if they had, they were now honoured ſufficiently, then they would have been worſhipt like Gods. And ſometimes in jeaſt, as his cuſtom was, he uſed to ſay, <hi>That there were a certain ſort of Phyſicians that were like the Biſhops; they had the Keyes of Binding and Looſing, and nothing elſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To wave what might further be ſaid of Mr. <hi>Culpeper</hi>'s Practice, I ſhall end with this, that by his ingenuity and induſtry he got the love and applauſe of all people; in ſo high an eſteem he was, that he had gained the general repute of the three Kingdoms; inſomuch, that though he was courted by his friends to alter the condition of his ſingle life, he would admit of no ſuch prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, till like a skilful Aſtrologer he had fixed his eyes upon the Firmament, where <hi>Venus</hi> the Star of his own Affections governed, ſurrendring all the powers and faculties of his ſoul to the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and beauty of Mrs. <hi>Alice Field,</hi> the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Mr. <hi>John Field</hi> and <hi>Alice</hi> his Wife, kinſwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of Mr. <hi>Simon Barckſtead,</hi> an eminent Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, owing two and twenty Lordſhips, free eſtate; whom it was his happineſſe afterwards to eſpouſe at fifteen years of age: a Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who as ſhe was of a good extraction, ſo alſo, beſides her richer qualities, her admirable
<pb facs="tcp:51945:21"/> diſcretion, and excellent breeding, ſhe brought him a conſiderable fortune: By her he had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Children, whereof Mrs. <hi>Mary</hi> was his fourth, now living with her Mother in <hi>Spitttle-fields,</hi> the true picture of her Father. Mrs. <hi>Culpeper</hi> while ſhe continued in that bleſſed ſtate of Matrimony fourteen years with him, ſhe ſo wiſely demeaned her ſelf, as never to entrench on his prerogative, not in the leaſt to diſturb his ſtudies; ſhe onely ſought to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain her own propriety in domeſtick Feminine Affairs; ſo that ſhe was all his time a Wife at her own diſpoſing, enfranchiſed, free-born from her Wedding-day. Neither while Mr. <hi>Culpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> was in health, did he go about to keep her in the wholeſome ignorance of ſuch unneceſſary Secrets, (as ſome ſuppoſe them) but that by her diſcreet obſervation of his practice, ſhe hath got the ſtart of moſt of her Sex now living, inſomuch, as ſince his death, to be in no leſs eſteem for her practice, then ſome of the other gender that boaſt of their leſſer knowledge. It was Mr. <hi>Culpepers</hi> uſual expreſſion in the time of his health, that though he could not do for her as ſhe deſerved, that he ſhould nevertheleſſe leave her a competent eſtate, (meaning that he ſhould enrich her with ſome Secrets of his Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice) which ſhe hath ſince in the <hi>Aurum Pota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile,</hi> and other rare Secrets, found happily veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to her own expectation. When Mr. <hi>Culpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> began firſt to decline in his health, he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſequeſter himſelf from the throng of the people; he ſtrove for a ſeaſon to obſcure
<pb facs="tcp:51945:21"/> his own name, which he found to be a moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible task; for being ſo long time laborious in his ſtudies, and having particular tryed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts, by which he had formerly done moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable cures, he was paſt all concealment. He being then ſo unexpectedly taken notice of, as to be put upon the Tranſlation of the Doctors <hi>Diſpenſatory;</hi> to his great aſſiſtance, and more happy accomodation, he had for ſome time to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a moſt ingenious <hi>Mannuenſis,</hi> one Mr. <hi>William Ryves.</hi> After the Diſpenſatory he writ ſeveral experienced Treatiſes amongſt others ineſtimable Aphoriſmes, ſome of them not much inferiour to thoſe of <hi>Hippocrates.</hi> It is not to be omitted, that amongſt other eminent Authors of our times, he had the fate to ſuffer under ſome works which he is likely to own to poſterity; ſome whereof are honourable inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, at which if he were now alive, he would be the leſs incenſed, if the more particular ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the perſon whom he deſerved ſo much from, had not been onely ſhewed to him in his life-time, but ſo, as after his death to aſperſe a genuine Work of his, intituled, <hi>His Legacies.</hi> It will be needleſs to mention other particulars, what diſguiſes and falſe pretences, for his ſelf-intereſt, this perſon hath been forced to make uſe of. To proceed.</p>
            <p>I ſhall paſs by Mr. <hi>Culpeper</hi>'s fighting of a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, for which he was forced to flie into <hi>France,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining there a quarter of a year till the cure was perfected at his own expences; as alſo his taking up of Armes, and ſome other croſs tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions
<pb facs="tcp:51945:22"/> of his life; I refer thoſe that are Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts to the conſideration of the before-named Scheme of his Nativity Calculated by that learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and admirable proficient in Aſtrology. Mr. <hi>John Gadbury,</hi> wherein they may finde in the Epitome, what I have hitherto more largely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on.</p>
            <p>For thy more pleaſant diverſion. Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Reader, I ſhall but onely touch lightly upon the nobleneſs of his diſpoſition; if it had been in caſe of a Patients neceſſity, nothing ſhould obſtruct, he would go all weathers; but if it had been onely for an Aſtrological queſtion in reſolving, of which he was excellent, except it were to pleaſure a ſpecial friend. He choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to walk abroad for therecreation of his tired ſpirits, then to tarry at home, and to get what he pleaſed to demand; he hath had forty that wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on him in a morning, whom he ſent all away with the ſame anſwer: inſomuch that one of the moſt eminent of the three Nations, in Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical and Phyſical knowledge, now living in the Countrey, then altogether unknown to Mr. <hi>Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peper</hi> hearing of his humor, came to town of purpoſe to try him; he had no ſooner after he had knockt entred the Parlor, but Mr. <hi>Culpeper</hi> was got half way on the ſtairs, and askt him bluntly, as his manner was, what he would have. The Doctor told him that he had come ſome miles to be reſolved of an Aſtrological queſtion, and that he would be very grateful to him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could almoſt ſpeak theſe words, Mr. <hi>Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peper</hi> turning himſelf round to go up ſtairs, told
<pb facs="tcp:51945:22"/> him that he would have nothing to do with his queſtion. Yes, but you would, replied the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, and laught, if you knew what it were. What it were, ſayes Mr. <hi>Culpeper!</hi> Why, what is it? Sayes the Doctor, Whether you will go to the Tavern and drink a glaſs of Sack. Ile re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve you that queſtion preſently, ſayes Mr <hi>Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peper,</hi> takes his Cloak, and immediately goes with him; in ſuch an humor his friend might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of him what he pleaſed, and never fail of an ingenuous and civil ſatisfaction. When Mr. <hi>Culpeper</hi>'s ſickneſs ſtole upon him, as he was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally conſumptive for ſome years together; he was ſo truly ſenſible of his declination, as that he was often heard to ſay, that Tobaco was the greateſt enemy he had to his health, but he was too much accuſtomed to it, to leave it. What Sir <hi>Theodore Mayern</hi> affirmed of the bad French-Wine, which he drank but a moderate quantity of at the Guilded-Lyon in the <hi>Strand,</hi> that it had killed him, as within few dayes after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards was found too true, might be as certainly ſaid of the deſtructive Tobaco Mr. <hi>Culpeper</hi> too exceſſively took; which by degrees: firſt depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him of his Stomach, and after other evil effects, in proceſs of time, was one of the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt haſtners of his death.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Culpeper,</hi> as hath been declared, for a long time perceiving his Sickneſs to increaſe more ſtrongly upon him, though he had held out the Siege with his moſt ſtudious endeavours to aſſiſt Nature with his beſt Art; yet ſtill finding as he made good one place to repair it, there was ſtill
<pb facs="tcp:51945:23"/> a Breach reinforced in another, Battery upon Battery. Seeing no remedy but that he muſt yield to the tyranny of the common Enemy, the Out-works being already taken in; though he knew with what inexpreſſible ſorrow his Wife muſt be afflicted to hear that doleful news, that till then he had concealed from her: but finding the approaches and infallible pangs of Death to have already ſeized on him, taking her by the hand, as ſhe ſtood by the Bed-ſide in a moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate condition, he breathed forth theſe his laſt Words to her: <hi>Deareſt, be not troubled, my peace I have already made with my God; I am now going out of this miſerable Life, to receive a Crown of Immortality, after our ſo long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance together, as Heaven hath thought fit, we muſt for the preſent part.</hi> At theſe words, Mrs. <hi>Culpeper</hi> being in a great agony, at laſt recollecting of her ſelf, ſaid, <hi>Sweet-heart, how canſt thou be ſo chearful when grim Death looks thee in the face?</hi> He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to raiſe himſelf a little higher, ſaid, <hi>My deareſt Girle,</hi> (an expreſſion he generally uſed) <hi>Live as I have done, and then thou wilt Dye as I do: for now I ſpeak it, when it is no time to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble, In the preſence of God and his Angels, I did by all perſons, as I would they ſhould do by me: I was alwayes juſt in my Practice: I never gave a Patient two Medicines when one would ſerve the turn. Farewel my Deareſt, I am ſpent.</hi> And ſo he exchanged this Life for a better. Not to take notice of ſuch Reports as attend perſons that are uſually envied for their eminent worth, the exceſs of my grief not ſuffering me to enlarge my ſelf;
<pb facs="tcp:51945:23"/> I ſhall onely write, to the great loſs and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all yong Practitioners, as alſo of the moſt learned Students in the Arts and Sciences, he exchanged this life for a more bleſſed. He dyed in his own houſe in <hi>Spittle-Fields</hi> the tenth day of <hi>January</hi> in 1653/4 in the thirty eighth year of his Age. He was buried in the New Church-yard of <hi>Bethelem,</hi> where he deſired to lie. Thus in the ſtrength and flower of his Age he departed this Life; who if he had lived but a few years longer, Chriſtendom had been filled with his Fame: he being for his general worth to be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred amongſt the beſt Philoſophers of his time. His learned friend Dr. <hi>Lawford</hi> in remembrance of him, cauſed this Elegaick Acroſtick to attend the Solemnity of his Funeral Scutcheons.</p>

            <p>MR. <hi>Culpeper</hi> was in his Deportment gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, pleaſing, and courteous. His Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plection darkiſh and ſwarthy. His Viſage rather long then round. Of a Preſence not ſo beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as amiable. His Hair black and ſomewhat curling. His Eyes piercing. His Body a little above a <hi>medium,</hi> tending to tallneſs. Of a ſpare lean Conſtitution. In his Apparel not exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moderation of one of his degree. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what careleſs. He was of a clear and eſtabliſht Judgement. Of an eloquent and good Utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Of a quick Spirit, full of ſwift Thoughts and mounting. Of a ſparkling ready Wit, a Gift which doth not alwayes ſpeak men Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. He was ſometimes too much overtaken with deep Speculations, though Melancholly
<pb facs="tcp:51945:24"/> was ſomewhat contrary to his nature; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he ſaid otherwiſe of himſelf: ſo that it may rather be imputed to the Croſſes of his Life, then to his own diſpoſition. His Health was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten diſturbed with a duſt Choller. Of Religion he had a greater ſhare then moſt Phyſicians uſe to have; he had ſo much Zeal as to hate Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, and was no friend to Epiſcopal Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. In his Counſels he was judicious; of a nimble Apprehenſion, with little difficulty in his Diſpatches. He was a perſon of ſo ready a minde, that he could more learnedly and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly dictate his Papers for the Preſs, then ſome that do take of the Lamp and the Oyl more ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly to contrive them.

For unqueſtionably, if he had not received the <hi>Benediction of Celeſtial Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> it muſt have been altogether contrary to humane Reaſon, that he could have arrived in ſo few years, to ſo ſuperlative a Judgement; his ſo well known Parts being ſuch as not onely to cauſe our three Kingdoms, but alſo Forreign Countreys, to admire both him and his Works. This his laſt Volume, which when I remained in his Houſe, the greateſt part of I had the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from his corrected Papers to tranſcribe. Mr. <hi>Culpeper</hi> finding himſelf ready to leave the World, intruſted it in the ſeveral Manuſcripts, in the hands of his aſſured Friends, who preſerved them, and looked to the faithful Publiſhing of them from the Preſs, by Mr. <hi>Nathaniel Brook,</hi> whom the Author deſigned as truly worthy of them; they are now perfectly Printed, as to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb facs="tcp:51945:26"/> the ſo long and earneſt expectation of them. As touching this Work, there needs no more to be ſaid of it, but that the Judicious will clearly perceive, that Mr. <hi>Culpeper</hi> hath through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole intire body of it, not onely cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, but fully ſupplied the Defects and Fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of moſt of the Doctors of theſe times. What his Abilities were to perform ſuch high undertakings, not onely this, but his other Works in Aſtrology, Chyrurgery, Phyſick, and other Arts and Sciences, have already ſo far te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, as to be above the cenſures of the exacteſt Criticks now living. Let it ſuffice, that his well-affected and earneſt deſire of the Publique Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit was ſuch, that had God given him a longer tearm of years, after Ages would have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged him their <hi>Great Informer.</hi> Either to praiſe his Tranſlation of the <hi>Doctors Diſpenſatory;</hi> his <hi>Judgement of Diſeaſes;</hi> or his contexture of them all in this <hi>School of Phyſick,</hi> is to as little purpoſe, as (according to the old ſaying) to light a candle to the Sun. It is enough, and above all other commendations, that this Work, by ſuch a cloud of Witneſſes, is ſo truly and really atteſted his own. As for my ſelf, I am ſo oblieged, as that I can do no otherwiſe, then gratefully confeſs, that in the time of my relation to him, I received more Knowledge and Light from him, then from all the Converſation I have ſince had either of Books or Men.</p>

                     </gap>m ſo hardy as to propound it to others to be received, whereof the firſt riſeth from the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Doctrine of Gods Providence, which as it ſerveth greatly to eſtabliſh the chiefe points
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51945:31"/> of Phyſophy, ſo being drawn, and more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly applied to the maintenance of mans life, carrieth with it as a ſufficient proviſion for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and preſervation of health, a like furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and as anſwerable to the neceſſity of the Patient, health being decayed. I will not ſtand to intreat of Providence, being well known to Chriſtians, and being a truth in Divinity, and Chriſtianity, cannot be falſe in Philoſophy. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the beſt of the Ancient Philoſophers and Poets have alwayes kept it as a ſure ground, who as they ſerve little to eſtabliſh us, having a ſurer foundation, yet may they juſtly condemne the Atheiſt of this Age, who ſo far hath quenched thoſe remnants of the light of the firſt Creation, that all things ſeem to him Fortune and Chance. There is no Nation under Heaven ſo poor and deſtitute, but it hath of the own Countrey ſoyl ſufficient to content Nature with, of Food and Apparel; which as they be two pillars of life, ſo from them are taken the means of preſervation of Health, which as to Beaſts are applied by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural inſtinct, ſo are they uſed of man by reaſon, the temperer of appetite and affection. This proviſion of ſuſtenance is moſt agreeable with the goodneſs of the Creator, who as he is Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of being to the Creature, ſo faileth he not to maintain and preſerve the ſame Creature the whole term of the being thereof: and becauſe the neceſſity of the Creature is perpetual, his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom hath alſo foreſeen, and provided a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſupply of ſuch ſuſtenance, as is fit for that Nature which ſtandeth in need thereof: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51945:31"/> the need is not once for all, but parted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to times, varying, according to the divers diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition and nature of that for which this proviſion is made, he hath alſo ſo beſtowed his goodneſs in this point, that at all times to all things, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary ſuſtenance ſhould not be to ſeek; and this extended not to men onely, but even to bruit beaſts, and all things which require nouriſhment. The end of this Proviſion is the preſervation of the Creature, which Nature moſt carefully ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieth (if it might be perpetual and eternal) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to to bring it, the goodneſs of the Creator, will have nothing wanting, his wiſdom will have it wait upon the neceſſity of the Creature: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the Earth is called the Mother of all things, not becauſe it bringeth them forth onely, but yieldeth them perpetual nouriſhment, ſo is the Countrey of all people to them named, the Parent of all parents. Then by Natures law, all things being abundantly miniſtred unto us for the preſervation of Health at home in our own Fields, Paſtures, Rivers, &amp;c. how can the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and his Goodneſs, ſtand with the abſence of Medicines and Remedies neceſſary for the recovery of Health, the need being as urgent of the one, as of the other: and ſo as great an occaſion of practice of the ſame Goodneſs and Wiſdom in the one as in the other? which being moſt plain and evident, it followeth neceſſarily, that the Medicine ſhould be as ready for the ſick, as meat and drink for the hungry and thirſty: which except it be appplied by the native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, cannot be elſe performed. It is known to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51945:32"/> ſuch as have skill in nature, what wonderful care ſhe hath of the ſmalleſt creatures, not onely gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to every part of them a careful diſcharge of ſundry duties, as of attraction, retention, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, expulſion of excrements, diſtribution, and ſuch like, but alſo to the whole creature, a knowledge of Medicine to help themſelves, if haply diſeaſes annoy them; neither out of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> nor <hi>Arabia,</hi> but from their very haunt: which being not denied to them, much more is granted to us, in ſo much as (the work of Nature being moſt excellent in man) ſhe is more vigilant over mankinde, then over other creatures, as by the ſhape thereof moſt plainly appeareth. The Swallow cureth her dim eyes with Celendine: the Weaſel knoweth well the vertue of Herb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace: the Dove the Vervine: the Dog diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chargeth his maw with a kinde of Graſs: the Spider is triacle to the Monkey: the Hippopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamus diſchargeth the abundance of his blood by opening a Vein: and Ibes is ſaid to have ſhewed the uſe of the Glyſter: and too long it were to reckon up all the Medicines which the Beaſts are known to uſe by Natures direction onely, and thoſe not ſo far fetched as our Drugs, but familiar with them, and taken from the place of their Food: it being very probable, ſhe hath beſtowed this gift even upon all, one having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Natures care as well as another. By this then may we gather, if Nature fail not the very beaſts in this behalf, neither ſendeth them to borrow afar off, much more is that performed unto us the Lords of all the Creatures, and for
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51945:32"/> whoſe uſe all things were created: except we be thought leſs ſubject to diſeaſes then they, wherein we be ſo little priviledged, that no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in that reſpect is ſo frail as we, and thoſe moſt ſubject to infirmities, which are governed and dieted by us. So that we of all creatures, have greateſt need of Natures liberal hand in this behalf. For be it for the moſt part, we are more healthful then ſickly, and ſo have greater uſe of the means of keeping Health, then of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring, yet hardly can a man ſay which of them is more neceſſary to be ready and preſt at hand, the danger of Diſeaſes being alwayes immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, although Diſeaſes themſelves be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes preſent. Now, if to any the reaſon ſeem weak from that which ſhould be to inferre a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof; we are to underſtand in the Works of God, whatſoever ſhould be, is: he being a Workman of an abſolute power and cunning. But ſaith one, The Eaſt and Weſt <hi>Indies, Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia, Barbary,</hi> the <hi>Red-ſea,</hi> are the Mines, as it were, and the Fountains of Medicines; and <hi>Spain, Portugal,</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> the Vents of ſuch things; and Navigation the means to obtaine them. It cannot be denied, but thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys yield many ſtrange things, whereof we take uſe with great delight, and Navigation ſerveth greatly for communicating of Commodities, and enterchange of Merchandize: but how far, and of what Commodities? Verily of ſuch, as if our delicacy would give us leave, we might very well ſpare, being things rather of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous pleaſure, then neceſſary reliefs, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51945:33"/> rather for a certain pomp, then for mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of life: and which without great work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the wits, might be proved to bring more harm to our Countrey men, then commodity; both in reſpect of the diverſity of complexion of our bodies from thoſe of ſtrange Nations to whom they properly belong, the corruption of their outlandiſh Wares, the ſelling of one thing for another, and the withholding from us the beſt of choice. But of this hereafter. Moreover, Navigation being of a later invention then the neceſſity of Medicine, neither practiſed of many Nations at this day, cannot ſupply this want; or if men began then firſt to be diſeaſed, when they began to finde wayes in the Sea to thoſe far Countreys, doth it not greatly detract from that Providence whereby all things are guided, to lay the recovery of mans health upon the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures of Merchants? and the Diſeaſe being in the one part of the world, to have the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine in the other: yea, as far diſtant as the Eaſt is from the Weſt, and the Life and Death of a man to ſtand upon a halfpenny weight of Scam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, or a dram or twain of Rhewbard. Nay, which is yet more abſurd, that the health of ſo many Chriſtian Nations ſhould hang upon the courteſie of thoſe Heathen and barbarous Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to whom nothing is more odious, then the very name of Chriſtianity; and who of malice do withhold from us ſuch Medicines as they know moſt for our uſe. Whereupon the Turk denieth unto the Chriſtians at this day, the <hi>Terra Lemnia,</hi> a Medicine to be preferred before the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51945:33"/> chief of thoſe we perſwade our ſelves to enjoy. The corruption of their Drugs, is it not ſo great, that in the light of all knowledge, ſcarce one is able to diſcern the right Bolus Armena, from the Ocre of <hi>Apulia;</hi> or to diſcover the adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating of Ambergreece, and Musk, with a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of other corruptions, which have gotten ſtrength by cuſtome of errour? Thamarinds are counterfeited with Prunes, Scammony with the milk of Spurge, Manna with Suger and the leaves of Sene, Aſpalathum with the inward part of the root of an Olive-tree, Frankincenſe with Roſin, Bdellium and Sarcocalla with gums: for Bolus Armena is ſold a Red earth out of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulia,</hi> for Malabathrum a leaf of a Lemon or Orange, for Turpeth ſome other root dipped at both ends in gum; which be as like in vertue to the Simples whereof they bear the viſard and mask, as Chalk to Cheeſe, according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb. And greatly thou art deceived, to think our Navigations ſtore us with ancient Medicines, wherewith Phyſick in old time hath been fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed: for at this day neither is Balm known unto us, neither is Xylobalſamum, nor Cardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momum, nor Amomum, neither Coſtus, neither Calamus odoratus, Aſpalathus, Agallocum, Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capthum, with the moſt of the noble ancient Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines: ſo that Navigation hath not at any time ſupplied this want unto us, and how it ſhould hereafter I know not, except <hi>Galen</hi> take pains again to ſail into <hi>Cyprus,</hi> into <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> and <hi>Lemnos,</hi> to gather and make choice with his own hands. For what hope is there to be had of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51945:34"/> Proviſion made by Merchants? who buy to ſell onely, and thereof to reap gain; and by reaſon they be unlearned, if they would be faithful, yet muſt they fail greatly in this point, and then muſt we uſe ſuch Medicines as we can come by, and the Patient recover ſuch health as he may. For the moſt part, theſe Drugs come out of <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>Portugal,</hi> either fetched of us, or brought of them; yet neither of them ever hath born name of yield of the beſt Simples, ſo that if they be of thoſe Countreys, then they are not ſuch as they ſhould be: if <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi> fetch them elſewhere, then lieth the aſſurance upon their credit. Or let me know how they diſcern the Coriander of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> the black Helleborus of <hi>Cyrene,</hi> the Amomum of <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia,</hi> the Myrrha Troglodytica, the Opium of <hi>Apulia,</hi> (which are counted the beſt) from the ſame growing in other places, which never car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried name of commendation for ſuch Simples. The Coloquintida growing alone upon the plant is much ſuſpected of good Phyſicians, the Squilla that hath no fellows, is thought to ſavour of a venemous nature, likewiſe the Thymelea. Now when theſe are gathered to the Merchants hand, who ſhall tell him how they grow, or who ſhall enquire but the Philoſopher, that knoweth what may come thereby to theſe Simples? Neither is the danger leſs in the manner of laying them up, and keeping them over long: beſides, the juſt time of gathering being either over-paſſed, or prevented, greatly diminiſheth the vertue of the Medicines. As the uſe of Euphorbium is perilous
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51945:34"/> before it be a year old, and after three years, it is nothing worth. So Agarick gathered before it be ripe, or kept paſt two years, becommeth unwholeſom. And as the Peony root is to be gathered in the wane of the Moon, and the Cray-fiſh to be taken after the riſing of the Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtar, the Sun entring into <hi>Leo,</hi> ſo are there many other, which if they miſs their due time of ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering, fail greatly in their vertues. To theſe corruptions moreover may be added the waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Sea, the long journeys they are brought, whereby it ſhould ſeem, nature had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied unto us the uſe of them, as to whom they were not of her yielded, with ſuch difficulty, and as it were, by conſtraint, they come to us. Then if the beſt of ancient Simples be partly unknown and wanting, partly adulterated, partly by age and other means ſpent before they come to our uſe, what ſhall we ſay to our Compounds and Mixtures, which riſe of theſe Simples? Can the temper mend them? or a <hi>quid pro quo,</hi> as they call them, ſerve the turn? No verily, not our turns, to whom the ſubſtitute Medicines, as I may call them, were not appointed, being in great part as hard to come by, as the Medicines whoſe ſubſtitutes they are, and as much unknown unto us. As for Agallicum, Calamus odoratus, for Amomum, Acorus, for Caſtorum, Bilphum, for Crocamagmo, Agallocus, with a number of the ſame ſort, which theſe few leaves of Paper will not admit. Neither is it to be thought theſe Lieutenant Medicines ſerve at all turns in the place of the right Medicines, for ſo ſhould Gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51945:35"/> ſerve the turn of Folefoot to purge by Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, which it cannot, no more then curds of Cow milk can ſoften and ſupple like butter, or the dung of the Stock-dove, purge like Euphor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bium; or the Dock-root draw phlegme from the Head like Pellitory; which <hi>Galen</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding maketh ſubſtitutes of theſe Medicines which have ſuch operation. I conclude therefore, ſeeing Navigation cannot afford us either the Simples, which we ſeem to need, and thoſe which it doth, both corrupt and counterfeit in the greateſt part; we have neither to crave thereof in this point aid, much leſs to truſt thereunto. Now the Simples being but (for the moſt part) baſtard Ware, how can the Compounds that amount of the ſame be other then counterfeit? Whereupon as <hi>Cardanus</hi> ſaith in his Method of Curing; The wiſe Magiſtrates of <hi>Venice</hi> have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes forbidden the making of Triacle and Mithridatum, becauſe the Simples could not be had, whereby they ſhould be compounded. Which if <hi>Venice,</hi> the greateſt Mart in this part of the World of ſuch Wares, cannot a vouch, what can we hope for from other places? That a man would marvel to ſee the great ſtore of them in all ſhops of Apothecaries under the names of Triacle and Mithridatum of Androma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus; and it being required in Triacle before it be uſed, it ſhould have a time, as it were of mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, which of <hi>Galen</hi> in his Book of Triacle to <hi>Piſo,</hi> is extended to twelve years: and of <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Aegineta</hi> in his ſeventh Book, by ſeven years, for thoſe that are bitten or ſtung of venemous

                     </gap>en years till it be twenty of age. I marvel what aſſurance we have of the age of this Triacle, which is ordinary in uſe; or if we have none, how we dare uſe it at adventure, knowing by age the vertue thereof hath no ſmall alteration. I would theſe inconveniences were the ſmalleſt, which I have but briefly, and as it were, for a taſte run over, yet were even they ſufficient to ſtay our overhaſty uſe of ſuch ſtrange Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, and to move us to betake us to thoſe we know, both in the Blade, and in the Seed, in the Root, and in the Fruit; and know the Air, the Hill, the Valley, the Meadow where they grow. But this truſt upon, Out-landiſh Medicines have much more nearly touched us then ſo. If a man would ſay by his overhaſty embracing, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſtrange Nations do as it were, purge over unto us, we drink divers times rank Poiſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of wholeſom Medicine, I think it would juſtly move us to be adviſed, and not to paſs over the enquiry of a reaſon, why ſuch a one ſhould think ſo, being one whoſe vocation tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the charge of the health of mens bodies. The right Hermodactiles are commended for excellent Medicines againſt all Pains in the Joynts; as the Gout, the Schyatica, and ſuch like, from which they purge groſs Phlegme. Doronicum Romanum, hath great commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for comforting the Heart, expelling Poiſon, againſt the Cough, for avoiding of Humours which overcharge the Cheſt; which are great

Now common experience teacheth us the great odds betwixt Scammony raw, as they call it, and the ſame corrected, which we name Dacrydium, both in vehemency of purging, and tormenting the body: yet hardly dare we paſs above twenty grains of the ſame, and this mixed with Cordials and ſtomach Medicines. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, their ſlender correcting of it, doth argue it to be far leſs noiſom to them then to us, who correct it onely, or at the leaſt, are contented with the correction thereof by a little Salt and and Pepper, or a little Ginger: who for the plenty of excellent Simples, which we both want and know not, and for their skill in the nature of thoſe we correct with, might as well have qualified it as we; who firſt waſh it in Roſe-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, wherein Cytrea Myrobalanus, Spike, and Cinamon have been boiled: in which alſo we let it ſteep four and twenty hours, then dry it, then mix it again with oyl of ſweet Almonds, and ſome Goom for Tragacantha, and laſt of all bake it in a Quince, covered round with paſte. Who hath not horror of the torments which both the Hellebores brings to the body? yet ſaith <hi>Paulus Aegineta</hi> in his ſeventh Book, and fourth Chapter, The black Helleborus purgeth yellow Choler from the whole body, without pain: which canndt be verified of our bodies, howſoever it be in theirs; and therefore we fear to miniſter the Powder thereof in any ſort, but

Theſe ſtrange workings of theſe forreign Drugs in our Bodies, and a more gentle and kinde work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in theirs, doth it not manifeſtly declare unto us, that they were not created for us? do they not force us oftentimes with peril of our lives to give them over? that the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent knoweth not divers times, whether he ſhould ſtand rather to the courteſie of his Diſeaſe, then of his Potion? There is a Simple which hath not many years been in uſe, brought out of <hi>India,</hi> and highly commended, called Mechoaca, it purgeth gently, ſay they, without vexing or grieving the body, without anoying the ſtomach greatly, and ceaſeth purging at your pleaſure, with a little ſupping. Theſe be great vertues doubtleſs, and I wiſh we could finde them in Mechoaca: for Experience the touchſtone hath bewrayed it in our bodies, to be of a far other operation; it tormenteth the body, it annoyeth the ſtomach much, neither doth a ſupping ſtay the vehemency of purging, and this have I part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by mine own experience found in Mechoaca, and partly by the experience of my friends, who upon the uſe thereof have much complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of theſe accidents.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51945:38"/> the natural Heat of the body, ſo that we fear to give thereof into the body above the weight of two grains, and thoſe corrected with Saffron, Caſtorium, and ſuch like, leſt it caſt the Patient into ſuch a deep ſleep, as he needeth the trump of the Archangel to awake him. Now, the ſame Opium being taken of the Turks, Moors, and Perſians, bringeth to their wearied and over-travelled bodies, a marvellous recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in ſuch ſort, as they ordinarily uſe it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as a preſent remedy, not in the quantity of two grains or twenty, but even an whole ounce or twain at once: And <hi>Hollerius</hi> in his <hi>Scholia</hi> upon his Chapter of Phrenſey, ſaith, That <hi>Ron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delet</hi> a learned Phyſician, and the French Kings Profeſſor at <hi>Montpellier,</hi> reported unto him, that he had ſeen a Spaniard take thereof into his body half an ounce at one time, without hurt.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51945:39"/> things, for then ſhould ſuch conſideration have place, but even of the very nature, which no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of uſe can alter. Yet are theſe Simples moſt excellent creatures of God, made for the uſe of men, but not for all men; and although we may receive help from them, by a certain generall community that our bodies have with thoſe of <hi>Arabia, Barbary,</hi> and the reſt; yet no doubt, as I have ſhewed in a few, ſo we receive by the uſe of them ſo much the leſs good by them, as we moſt differ from them, and that which wanteth of the performance of good to us, muſt needs turn us to much harm, the unhelping part, (as I may call it) always working, and ſo ever harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Neither do I ſee why the Medicines of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> or <hi>Egypt</hi> ſhould be laid upon us, more then the <hi>Indian</hi> or <hi>Egyptian</hi> diet; which is to eat Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards, Dragons, and Crocodiles: for if the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Medicine doth alwayes regard his proper ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, which cauſeth the diſeaſe (as no doubt it ſhould do) then there being a great difference betwixt our humors and theirs, as much in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as is betwixt the fleſh of a Crocodile and of a tender Capon; our medicines which are to fit us, muſt needs be of another kinde then theirs, which in our bodies not finding ſuch humors and excrements, as that ſtrange diet doth ingender, muſt needs ſeize upon the very ſubſtance of our bodies, to have ſomewhat to work on: which painful working eſpecially of the purgers, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the common ſaying amongſt the people, to the great diſcredit of our Art: There is not a purgation, but it hath a ſmack of poiſon. Truth
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51945:39"/> it is, no purgation can work without natures an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyance, being in part a prick of nature to avoid her excrements: but when ſhe is ſo provoked that ſhe ſweateth cold ſweats, that ſhe giveth over, that the patient ſoundeth not by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of purging onely, but for the moſt part through the evil quality of the medicine, it is ſurely an argument, it wanted his proper ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to work in. If needs we will take unto us the practice of ſuch ſtrange Medicines, (I call them Medicines according to the common phraſe, elſe properly be they matter onely it were to be deſired (which in part is performed) that ſuch Medicines as be ſo perillous, might be planted in our natural countrey, that through the familiarity of our ſoil, they might firſt grow into acquaintance with us, before we entertain them, not into our boſomes, but into our hearts, and chamber them with our vital ſpirits. And as it is ſaid of the tree Perſea, which in <hi>Perſia</hi> being poiſon, tranſlated into <hi>Egypt,</hi> becometh whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, bearing fruit to be eaten, and good for the ſtomach: ſo thoſe natures receiving ſuch miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of our ſoil, might in time better fit us then they do, which as it cannot alter their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, being impoſſible to be done by change of place, ſo doubtleſs might it purge away that evil quality which annoyeth us, and ſeemeth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be an evil complexion, and as it were a cacochimy and diſeaſe of the thing, then any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary propriety belonging to the nature. This which hath been ſaid of <hi>Perſia,</hi> is alſo to be ſeen in other Simples, which in other places are poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51945:40"/> and kill with the very ſhadow, yet brought into <hi>England,</hi> and planted with us, clean change that venomous quality. Ugh called Taxus, of <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> is ſaid to be ſo dangerous, and of ſuch venomous nature, that in <hi>Navar</hi> the very ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow thereof poiſoneth him that ſleepeth under it: and <hi>Aegenita</hi> ſaith, being taken inward, it ſtrangleth, and ſwiftly killeth. This Taxus not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, being ſo perillous in other places, our Engliſh ſoil hath ſo reformed, that boldly our children do eat of the fruit thereof without danger: the like may be verified of our Hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock, which although it be to be numbred among the poiſoning Herbs, yet it is far behinde that which groweth in <hi>Candy,</hi> or <hi>Megara,</hi> or <hi>Cili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> ſcarce to be accounted poiſon, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that in thoſe Countreys. Now if thou ſhalt think (gentle Reader) as the change of a Region altereth ſome qualities, ſo all, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by empaireth the vertue of the Medicine; thou mayeſt eaſily be deceived. For as they depend not one upon another, ſo may the one be well without the other, though by one common form they ſeem to be linked together to make one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Rhewbarb is known to have two qualities, one contrary to another, of purging the body, and ſtopping: yet by ſteeping may the one be ſeparated from the other, the purging vertue being drawn out by ſteeping, and the ſtopping ſtill remaining in the ſubſtance ſteeped: ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe may the noiſom quality of the Medicine be eſchewed, the wholeſome and medicinable vertue notwithſtanding, being in full force, yea
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51945:40"/> greater retained, I ſay greater, inſomuch as the hurtful quality would hinder the operation of the healthful, which being freed and unyoked from the other, doth far better accompliſh his work. Of all kindes of Honey that of <hi>Greece,</hi> and namely of <hi>Attica</hi> and <hi>Hible</hi> are moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, the next price is given to the Honey of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Navar:</hi> yet it is certainly known by experience, that the Engliſh Honey is moſt agreeable to our Engliſh Bodies, and greater quantity thereof may be taken, with leſs an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyance, yea, none at all to thoſe which are not of too hot a temper: the other kindes being more fiery, more apt to engender Choler, and to inflame the blood, and more unfit to looſe the body. Whereby we may evidently ſee, that Nature uſeth not one ſhoe for every foot, but either miniſtreth a divers commodity in kinde, or elſe by the Countrey, Air, and Soil, doth ſo temper it, that greater uſe may be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to the inhabitant of the ſame Countrey. By this then which hitherto hath been ſaid, it is manifeſt we receive great hurt by the uſe of ſtrange Medicines, and not upon reaſon onely, but from plain experience, even with hurt to our own bodies, which as it is the greateſt price of knowledge, ſo therefore ought we the more to ſet thereby, and more carefully to ſeek to avoid the danger. Again, it is evident, that the planting of ſtrange Simples frameth them more to our uſe. Wherefore as there be many excellent Gardens in <hi>England,</hi> eſpecially in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> repleniſhed with ſtore of ſtrange and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landiſh
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51945:41"/> Simples, it were to be wiſhed ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours were of others followed, that ſo we might acquaint us better with theſe ſtrangers, and by <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſu capio</hi> make them our own. But what ſoils will brook all things? it is true, yet no doubt of thoſe that it will brook, which I dare ſay are four or five hundred; this frugality of nature toward us as it is thought, might bear a greater ſhow, and more ſafely uſe them, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the purgers, which carry with them great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt anoyance. Now if it be objected, the force of outlandiſh Simples are thereby more feeble, as we finde the <hi>Organ</hi> of <hi>Candy</hi> ſurpaſſing ours in ſtrength, I mean the ſame kinde with that of <hi>Candy</hi> planted in the Gardens, which may be ſaid alſo of other ſtrange Herbs planted by us. It cannot be denied but they are ſo, neither can the ſtrange Simples in all points be equal with his kinde, keeping his Native ſoil; yet is the difference ſcarce half a degree under, or if it were a degree full out, what reaſon were it to fetch that one degree with much peril, and charge, as far as <hi>Candy, Spain,</hi> or <hi>Venice,</hi> or from another world: whereas a little increaſe of the quantity of the thing, would eaſily ſupply that want, though I mention not the gain of freſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſame, which maketh no ſmall recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of wanting in the force: neither is the nature or vertue of a Medicine to be eſteemed by taſte or ſmell, neither by the force it hath againſt the diſeaſe, the nature of a medicine lying in an equal matching of the cauſe of the diſeaſe, which if it overmatch, ſo far off it is from the praiſe
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51945:41"/> of an wholeſome medicine, that it becommeth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>he beſt Phyſicians is, if the diſeaſe will bear any delay, as the moſt do, rather to apply a medicine of weaker force, then at once with a vehement <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>one, to ſhake the frame of Nature. And the weaker medicine being weak, either in reſpect of the nature of the Simple, or the ſmall quantity, they counſel rather to uſe that kinde of curing, which is by the feebler medicine in kinde, then by reaſon of the under quantity. For what skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Phyſician would cure a ſmall diſtemper of heat, and as it were in the firſt degree, with a ſmall quantity of Opium, or Mandrake, or Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane, being cold in the fourth degree, rather then with the juſt quantity of Endive, or Succo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or diminiſh a ſmall exceſs of humors, with an under quantity of Coloquintida or Scammony, rather then with the juſt quantity of a feebler medicine? Wherefore upon good reaſon they conclude it to be far ſafer for the Patient, to cure with contraries of feebler force, either often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, or in a greater quantity applied, then with a main force of a medicine of equal ſtrength at once to expel the diſeaſe, Nature abhorring all vehement and ſudden either emptying or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, heating or cooling, or any other kinde of ſudden alteration, which being grounded upon good reaſon, the delaying of the force of ſtrange medicines by our ſoil, ſerveth greatly for the commendation both of planting them with us,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51945:42"/> and of the Medicines themſelves planted. The Simple ſtill keeping within the compaſs of the matter of a Medicine, neither being ſo diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that by increaſe of the quantity, it may match with the diſeaſe, which no man with reaſon can deny. Now, if the greatneſs of the quantity happily procure loathſomneſs to the Patient by extraction, that inconvenience may eaſily be avoided: by which means a pound may be brought to an ounce, an ounce to a dram, and a dram to a few grains, to pleaſe the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient with. Such of ſtrange Medicines as will not brook our Climate, thereby declare the evill diſpoſition they have to cure the infirmity of our bodies. Every Medicine is as it were a mean betwixt nouriſhments and poyſons, excepting thoſe Medicines which are applyed outwardly, which may both be of nouriſhments and poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. In this mean betwixt theſe extreams, there is ſuch a ſcope and breadth, that ſome Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Yea, hath God given to the Beaſt a remedy out of his own food and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture (as it is moſt certainly known) with a skill to uſe it, and hath he ſet a Journey as far as from the Sun-riſing to the going down, as it were a wall of Braſs, and the fiery ſword of a Cherubim to keep us from the attaining of Salves for our Sores? Juſtly may we thus complain, eſpecially thoſe of the poorer ſort. And if Phyſick (as it is indeed) be an Art common to all kinde of men, all ſorts of nations, all eſtates and conditions of men; I would know why the means alſo of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the actions belonging to the ſame Art, ſhould not be as common? And if it be ordinary to all Nations to fetch their Medicines far, let me know why, as we ceaſe not to travel for to ſtore us with outlandiſh Drugs, we carry not thither alſo our Countrey Medicines for change; or they of thoſe Nations give not the like Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture for ours? but they are contented with their own ſtore, and ſo ought we with ours. If it be not ordinary, why ſhould it be more extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary to one then to another. The moſt of our Apothecary Ware is bought from the moſt vile and barbarous Nations of the world, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all from the profeſſed enemies of the Son of God: ſhall we ſay, the Lord hath not care, or ſetteth more ſtore by them then by his own people? that he ſo furniſheth them, and leaveth us deſtitute? or ſhall we rather condemn the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of our own mindes, who unſatiably deſire ſtrange things, little regarding, or rather loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51945:43"/> that which is always at commandment? But God (ſaith one) hath not beſtowed all things upon all Nations, but hath left ſomething to be ſupplied by the Commodities wherewith one Nation aboundeth, and another wanteth; that thereupon mutual duties ariſing, the ſociety of men might be upholden. Which objection, if it carried with it what things they were, and of what kinde, that one Nation ſupplieth to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and what ſort of Commodities they be that one Nation needeth the help of another in, a more direct anſwer might be made then other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe I may hit upon: but I gueſs it is neither of Water, nor Fire, nor yet of Air, nor of any thing neceſſary for maintenance of life, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſhould the Native Countrey of each one be rather a ſtepdame to us then a natural mother; but it is of thoſe things onely which with health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and luſty Bodies we might be without, if cuſtome had not too much prevailed with us. And to go no further then to the uſe of Wine in <hi>England,</hi> in many reſpects it greatly hurteth us, yet our ordinary uſe thereof, hath given us ſuch a longing thereafter, that we think if we ſhould want it, many of our dayes were thereby abrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; whereby notwithſtanding Rhewms are mightily increaſed, the Sinews feebled, the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Moiſture and Heat of the body overhaſtily waſted, and ſwift old Age brought upon us, with an infinite number of diſcommodites beſides. Which the Nations finding where we have it; do ſo delay it, that rather they ſeem to drink wined Water, then watered Wine, except the aged, or
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51945:44"/> ſuch as are feeble ſtomached. And divers Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which may have of the beſt, becauſe they would be ſure to baniſh the uſe of it, count it ſacriledge to taſte it: as the Turks at this day, who uſe inſtead thereof a diſtilled water of Rice ſteeped in Milk, thereby ſupplying the uſe of Wine. Neither do we finde this diſcommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of Wine by the abuſe of drunkenneſs or ſurfeting onely, but even keeping within the three cups that <hi>Eubolus</hi> powreth out to wiſe men: whereof the firſt is of health and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment: the ſecond of mirth, and joy of heart: and the third of ſleep, ſo that a draught or twain doth marvellouſly diſtemper our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: which inconvenience we finde not by our ordinary drink; yea, though it be ſtronger then wine. If I ſhould compare our Mede with the beſt Wine, and the Metheglin of the Welchmen with Malmſie, I could take great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments from the nature of Honey to prove it. Eſpecially being tempered with certain whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Herbs, which have vertue to ſtrengthen the parts of the body. And by experience it is known, that Honey mixed with water, turneth in time to a wholeſome liquor, in taſte much like to Wine. Whereupon <hi>Pena</hi> in his Chapter of Honey, folio 22. doubteth not to affirm, that the Mede of the <hi>Polonians</hi> and <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> and the Metheglin of the Welchmen, are more wholeſome and pleaſant, then many of the beſt kindes of Wines, he himſelf being a French man, and therefore in his judgement leſs partial. Wherefore to conclude this argument,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51945:44"/> ſeeing, Wine (which is the glory of ſtrange Merchandiſe) is but an hurtful ſuperfluity, the reſt muſt needs be far other then neceſſaries. But Medicines being ſuch, as without which our health and life runneth into infinite perils, by cauſes inward and outward, through breach of Diet, unwholeſomneſs of Meat, Wounds, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of venemous Beaſts, Infections of the Air, and ſuch like, it followeth neceſſarily, that they be not ſuch as God would have one Nation gratifie another with; which if they were, greater reaſon were it to charge the neighbour Nations therewith, that thereby their mindes, might with performance of ſuch mutual duties, ſo neceſſary, be in ſtreighter amity and peace linked, who ceaſe not, for the enlarging of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, to vex one another, rather then the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſo far diſtant, who have neither fellowſhip of love, nor quarel of hatred equal with the Borderers.

Theſe be the reaſons which move me to ſuſpect the uſe of ſtrange Drugs, and drive me to think, that Nature hath better provided for us; and as the Indian, Arabian, Spaniard, have their Indiſh, Arabian, and Spaniſh Medicines, ſo alſo the Germane hath his, the French man his, and the Engliſh man his own proper, belonging to each of them. I know, gentle Reader, nothing doth more hinder the accepting of truth divers times, (eſpecially with ſuch as ſee with other mens eyes) then the perſon of him who firſt propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the matter, being taken rather to be an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of one, then an undoubted truth to be cheriſhed of all, as who have intereſt therein. Wherefore that ſuch might be ſatisfied, I will adde to my former reaſons, taken from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing, the authority of moe Doctors then one, who agreeing with this which I hold, may be a means, to draw the gentle Reader the more ſeriouſly to conſider of this matter, and truth may take ſome ſtrength thereby, and win the more credit. <hi>Pliny</hi> in his four and twenty Book of his Hiſtory, and firſt Chapter, hath this Sentence, thus much in Engliſh: Nature would that ſuch onely ſhould be Medicines, that is to ſay, which eaſily might be come by of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people; eaſie to be found out, without charge, taken from the things whereby we live; but in proceſs of time, the craft of men, and ſleights of their wits, found out theſe ſhops of ſtrange drugs, in which a ſale of mens lives is
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51945:46"/> offered, whereupon confectious, and infinite mixtures began to be extolled. <hi>India</hi> and <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia</hi> a man would think he were in them, and for a little gall or ſmall ulcer, a medicine muſt be fetched from the Red Sea: whereas every day the pooreſt do ſup with true medicines. And in his two and twenty Book, and four and twenty Chapter, We do not meddle (ſaith he) with the medicines taken from the merchandiſe of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> and <hi>Arabia,</hi> or of the New World, they are not fit for medicines and remedies: they grow too far off, they are not for us, no, not for the Nations where they grow, elſe would they not ſell them away. If we ſhall needs uſe them (ſaith he) let them be bought for ſweet perfumes, and ſweet oyles, and dainties, or to ſerve ſuperſtition, becauſe when we pray, we burn Frankencenſe and Coſtus. And thus much out of <hi>Pliny,</hi> whoſe judgement, as it is ancient, of a thouſand years, ſo is it of him, who moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently ſought out the myſteries of nature, and publiſhed them for the uſe of poſterity. Now if haply it be objected, that <hi>Pliny</hi> might well veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie that of <hi>Italy,</hi> which <hi>England</hi> cannot performe, we muſt underſtand, that <hi>Pliny</hi> reaſoneth from nature, which ſerveth for all nations of the world as well as for <hi>Italy,</hi> and directeth his Pen, not onely againſt the medicines ſtrange to <hi>Italy,</hi> but even againſt all that are far fetched and dearly bought, as appeareth plainly by his words. To this ſentence of <hi>Pliny,</hi> I will adde the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of two Phyſicians of late time, leſt <hi>Pliny</hi> being no Phyſician, ſhould be thought an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:51945:46"/> teſtimony. <hi>Fuchſius</hi> in his firſt Book of compounding of Medicines, and ſeventy ſix Chapter, thus agreeth with <hi>Pliny.</hi> If we were not ſo carried away with the admiration of ſtrange things, and were not fools (ſaith he) who had rather uſe medicines fetched from ſtrange and far countries, (contemning our native medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines) then ſuch as grow in our gardens: we might make honey ſerve in ſtead of <hi>Manna.</hi> But with the exceeding coſt and charge which thoſe medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines put us unto, we are worthily puniſhed for our folly. Loe, here two witneſſes, the one a great Philoſopher, and the other both a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher and a Phyſician, comparable with the beſt of late dayes.</p>
                  <p>The third witneſs with <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Fuchſius,</hi> is, <hi>Martino Rulandus,</hi> to whom the ſtudents of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick owe much for his <hi>Medicina practica,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther works. This <hi>Rulandus</hi> in his Preface to <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicina practica,</hi> hath theſe words; thus in Engliſh: We have ſimple medicines (eaſily had, homely, of our own countrey of <hi>Germany,</hi> to be bought with little money or none at all) ready (ſaith he) and intreated of in writing, by which onely all kindes of diſeaſes are certainly and undoubtedly cured, oftentimes better and much more eaſily (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve reaſon and experience, ſaith he) (and that with no hurt or danger) then with the long compounds of the Apothecaries, which are coſtly, evil gathered, without knowledge of the Phyſician, oftentimes unperfectly mixed, and unskilfully confuſed, and as unskilfully boyled; oftentimes putrified, and by age of force
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:51945:47"/> waſted, ſlovenly and with great negligence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. In which words <hi>Rulandus</hi> briefly hath comprehended, in a manner, all the diſcommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of ſtrange Medicines. Theſe teſtimonies I rather have alleadged, gentle Reader, that thou mayeſt know this my opinion, is not mine onely, and new ſprung up from the leaſure of a Student, who might eaſily be overtaken with a ſpeculation, which never could be ſhewen in uſe and practice, but hath with it the voice of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and ſuffrages of excellent Philoſophers and Phyſicians, although they have not of purpoſe, and in a ſet Treatiſe handled this Argument, as thou ſees: which, notwithſtanding, containeth indeed the matter of a great Volume. Hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hath been ſhewed the great inconveniences and dangers which riſe of the uſe of ſtrange Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, by reaſon, by experience, by authority of Phiſolophers and Phyſicians. If my reaſon be evil gathered, the experience falſe, the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity not authentical, what have I loſt thereby? A few hours meditation, and a few lines writing, or my credit impaired, will ſome ſay. If my credit could either buy ſuch vertues to ſtrange Medicines, as they carry the name, or purge the ſhops of counterfeit ſtuff, or redeem the harms they have done, I would verily eſteem as much of the change, as he which made exchange of Braſs for Gold. Although I ween it be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety to mans weakneſs unavoidable of any to erre, and therefore if obſtinacy be not therewith coupled, alwayes found pardon. But if my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments riſe from the cauſes and effects of theſe
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:51945:47"/> foreigners, and cauſes and effects of our bodies, which are of all Arguments the moſt forceable to eſtabliſh, or overthrow any thing to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided by reaſon, and the authorities ſuch, as juſtly exception cannot be taken againſt: blame me not (gentle Reader) though I be carried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this perſwaſion my ſelf, and of a love and zeal to benefit thee, have publiſhed that which I have conceived of this Argument. If I be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in my judgement of ſtrange Drugs, (which I wiſh with all my heart I were) theſe reaſons, the woful experience, the authority of ſuch men have induced me. Which if all may be anſwered, that which ſeemed more then doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful before, ſhall by this Controverſie ſhine moſt clear; and truth as it were wrought with the fire of reaſon, receive greater ſtrength and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
                  <p>Thus much touching the unableneſs of ſtrange merchandiſe to perform unto us ſufficiency, yea any meaſure of medicines as belonging unto us properly, and the diſcommodities of them. Now if ſtrange medicines ſerve not our turns, and all medicines be either ſtrange or home-born, it muſt needs follow, that the home medicines are moſt naturall and kinde to us, except a man would ſay, all medicines bring harm unto us which is not of the nature of a medicine, being an inſtrument of performing remedies unto us, or if it were ſo, yet have we this by experience, that ſtrange medicines do more annoy us then ſtrangers, yea deſtroy us, and reſtore them: wherefore home medicines, and of our Countrey
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51945:48"/> yield, of equity muſt neceſſarily perform the ſame to us, which their medicines do to them. Elſe I would know, why we ſhould be inferiour unto them, or one Nation more priviledged that way then another, the need being common, and the providence of God all one; yea, ſuch as rather then remedy ſhould need the chariot of the Sun to fetch it from one end of the world to the other, or be ſo far to ſeek as our common Druggs are, he hath linked the remedy in many things, ſo ſtraitly to the cauſe of our hurt, that even the ſelf ſame which harmed us, carrieth with it amends. As the Scorpion rubbed upon his ſtinging, cureth the ſame. Likewiſe the <hi>Rany</hi> divided, and applyed hot to the wound, cureth her venemous biting, and ſo the <hi>Paſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca marina,</hi> as it bringeth moſt dangerous hurt, it refuſeth not (being thereto applied) to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter remedy. Which practiſe of nature might ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily move us to think, her meaning is not to ſend us either into <hi>Arabia</hi> or <hi>India</hi> for aid for our griefs, but thereby to commend her care unto us, and give occaſion of praiſing Gods providence, and ſtirring us up to make diligent ſearch into our own proviſion, and to make better trial, then we are wont of the ſame. Wherein the great liberality of GOD appeareth in ſuch large meaſure, that rather ſuperfluity, then ſparing may be noted herein: in that both one ſimple nature carrieth with it the vertue of many medicines, and many ſimples, remedies againſt ſuch diſeaſes as we might be thought like never to be ſubject unto, and ſuch things as in reſpect
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:51945:48"/> of their nature might ſeem vile unto us, afford us (being skilfully applied) moſt ſovereign medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine: whereof for a taſte I give two or three ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples; Milke is either to be conſidered in all the parts together, or them ſevered. All kinde of Milke boiled, eſpecially burned with ſtones taken from the ſea-ſhore, helpeth all inward ulcers, chiefly of the jawes, the lungs, the guts, the bladder, and the kidneys; it is good againſt the itch and wheals, and it helpeth bloody flixes. New Milke is good againſt frettings made with poiſons received inward: as of Cantharides and ſuch like: it is profitably gargled againſt ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and frettings in the jaws. The whay of Milk is good to purge the body, eſpecially of ſuch as be melancholike, and diſpoſed to the falling ſickneſs, leproſie, and breaking out with ſcabs. The cheeſie part of it, as curds, freſh without ſalt, ſoftneth the belly; which preſſed and broiled ſtayeth the laxe. Cheeſe laid on, helpeth the inflamation of the eyes. The butter of Milke drunk, ſoftneth the belly, and ſerveth againſt poiſon for want of oil, rubbed upon their gums with honey helpeth the toothing of children, and cureth the itching of their gums and ſores of their mouthes. It helpeth ſuch as are bitten of the ſerpent called <hi>Aſpis.</hi> The ſoot of butter is very effectual againſt watering eyes, and ſwiftly skin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ſores. Thus thou ſeeſt, Reader, what trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is hid in Milke, (even an excrement) being uſed both whole and in parts. That which I have ſaid of Milke, belongeth alſo to moſt of creatures, which both all ſerve for medicine and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:51945:49"/> each of them for ſundry purpoſes: whereby natures endeavour to furniſh us with all help of medicine may evidently appear; yea, moſt of all, when ſhe ſeemeth to be ſo jealous over our health, that ſhe provideth againſt Dryſinus, againſt the Scorpion, the Viper, and Ceraſtes, and the moſt of venomous bitings of Serpents, wherewith notwithſtanding we are not as other nations encumbred, and thoſe not common me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines onely, but even proper unto them. As the venom of Dryſinus is abated and utterly extinguiſhed with the Trifolie, and with all kinde of maſt, be it of the Beech or Oke, or of any kinde of tree that beareth Acorns. Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial cureth the Scorpions ſting. Againſt the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a Viper, Garlike, Onions, and Leeks new gathered, are principal triacles wherewith alſo the venom of Ceraſtes is overmatched. <hi>Ergo,</hi> if Nature fail us not againſt the venome of ſtrange <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

That which hath been ſaid of venom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Beaſts, may alſo be ſhewed in the cure of ſtrange Diſeaſes, wherein Nature ſeemeth to be as careful as in the other. The French pocks is an Indian Diſeaſe, and not known to this part of the world within this hundred years, before that voyage of <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperor, which he took againſt <hi>Naples,</hi> where being brought over with

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:51945:50"/> then againſt them: which being evident, let us conſider how juſtly nature may be blamed to fail in the proviſion of medicines. Scarce would a man look for any great vertue of medicine in the Worms of the earth, being a creature ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; yet joyn they and glew together wounded ſinnews; they cure Tertians, they help the pains of the ears, the Toothache, and the powder of them drunken, provoketh urine. The little ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine called Sowes, which being touched runne together round like a peeſe; who would think they cured the difficulty of making water, the Jaundies, the Quinſey? For which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes they be of great force, and for to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge ſtuffed Lungs, with tough and groſs hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, nothing may be compared. Likewiſe the Cornes of Horſe legs called <hi>Lichenes,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be baſe and vile excrements, yet help they ſuch are taken with the Falling-ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The decoction of Frogs with Salt and But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is a treacle againſt the bitings, ſtingings, and poiſons of all Serpents; and the aſhes of them burnt, ſtayeth the Flux of bloud being thereto applyed. Theſe baſe creatures the rather I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, that being known, the treaſures which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath hid and laid up in them, with ſuch va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of vertues, we might the better eſteeming of her benefits, and the bleſſings of our own countrey, both acknowledge them, accept them, and be more thankful unto God for them. The which baſe creatures, the viler they ſeem to be, the more commend they the goodneſs of the Creator, who would not the abjecteſt thing that
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:51945:50"/> is, ſhould altogether be without, wherewith to ſerve, and do homage to his Lord and Maſter: which if theſe things afford us, what may we juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promiſe to our ſelves, and require of the reſt, more excellent creatures? Let not the reaſon ſeem ſtrange and weak to the Reader, who art a Chriſtian, which is taken from the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Wiſdom of GOD, to prove the ſufficiency of his execution and performance of the ſame. For if <hi>Galen</hi> thought it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, (as it is moſt reaſonable,) to gather the Wiſdom and Providence of the Creator by his work in the Creature, and maintenance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which he, in the end of his Books of the uſe of Parts, calleth a point of Divinity, far to be preferred above the whole Art of Phyſick: much more reaſonable is it for me, and the reaſon ſounder which is drawn from that Divine Providence, to the practice thereof. And if <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> had that religion in him, being a Gentile, and groping onely in the miſt of natural knowledge of God, could not ſatisfie himſelf with a Pſalm or Hymn (as he himſelf calleth it) of ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen ſtaves, every ſtaff containing an whole Book (for thus he himſelf calleth his Books of the uſe of Parts) of the wiſdom of the moſt wiſe God, eſteeming that duty more acceptable unto him, then ſacrifices of an hundreth Oxen, or the moſt coſtly perfumes and incenſe: Let it not be harſh in thine ears, gentle Reader, to hear now and then the goodneſs of our God, his Wiſdom and Providence, to be both intreated of, and advanced of a Chriſtian Phyſician, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:51945:51"/> to Chriſtians, to whom the Son of righteouſneſs hath ſhined, and ſcattered thoſe miſts of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral darkneſs, and hath given the earneſt of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality. And be aſſured there is no truth in Philoſophy, but may ſtand with, ye rather may reſt, and be upholden of Chriſtianity. But let us proceed. <hi>Julius Baſſus, Nicerates,</hi> and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronius Niger,</hi> as ſaith <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> thought their countrey Medicines, and thoſe which the native ſoyl yielded, moſt worthy to be exactly intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of them; belike, either thinking them ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for the inhabitants, or more agreeable with them. Which homely practice of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions where he travelled, <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> confeſſeth to have been the matter whereof he compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his golden Book of Medicines, which at this day remaineth a rich ſtorehouſe to all Phyſicians. Now then I would know why we ſhould more be provided of Medicine againſt one diſeaſe, then another, of our countrey yield? Is it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch diſeaſes which require ſtrange Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines are more dangerous, or leſs? If more dangerous, then ſhould the remedy for them be more at hand, then for other: if leſs, why are then the ſtrange Medicines eſteemed as moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible? And if we be leſs ſubject to ſuch diſeaſes as are cured with them, and ſo the abſence of them may ſeem tollerable, why then are Tertian Agues chiefly cured with Thamarines and Rhewbarb? Whereof the one cometh out of <hi>India,</hi> and the other, for the moſt part, out of <hi>Barbary.</hi> Whatſoever nature is yielded to any Nation, it ſerveth either for nouriſhment or
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:51945:51"/> Medicines, or being neither nouriſhment or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, is plain poyſon. Now a ſubduction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made of each of theſe, one from the other, what part ſhall we think will nouriſhments leave to Medicines? A far greater doubtleſs then they themſelves be, and as they exceed nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſo greatly do they and beyond all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon exceed the poyſons. Wherefore if the moſt of creatures in every Nation, be a fit mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Medicine, greatly no doubt are all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſtored with them: which ſtore declareth, that as diſeaſes partly riſe of breach of Diet, and partly through poyſons; ſo Nature would fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us with Medicines in number anſwerable to the cauſes of both, which being not ſufficient, argueth that Nature miſſeth of her purpoſe, having ſufficiently declared her endeavour: but Nature alwayes bringeth her works to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, except in caſe of Monſters, which are not ordinary. Wherefore her will, (ſhe being an inſtinct of Gods) ever going with the execution thereof, muſt needs perform that to us, which he pretendeth in the variety. But that thou mayeſt (gentle Reader) have better hold and greater aſſurance of the ſufficiency of thy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey Medicines, I will ſet down briefly, according to the variety and ſorts of all diſeaſes cured with medicine, Medicines taken from our native ſoyl anſwerable unto them, and effectual to cure them. And becauſe Medicines have relation to diſeaſes, I will firſt touch the diſeaſes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to joyn the Medicines. All diſeaſes are either in the complexion, or frame of the body: ſuch as
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:51945:52"/> are in the complexion are all cured by Medicine, which I named in the beginning of this Treatiſe, one of the inſtruments of Phyſick. Of diſeaſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> in the frame, theſe onely are cured with Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines. Quantity ſuperfluouſly increaſed, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed: obſtructions, over ſtreightneſs, or over largeneſs of paſſages in the body. Theſe are onely the diſeaſes properly to be cured with medicine: other diſeaſes which riſe of theſe, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their own accord, vaniſhing by the cure of theſe, or elſe to be cured by ſurgery, as evil figure and ſhape through want of proportional quantity, that being reſtored, the figure forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with returneth, or if not, rather is to be cured with help of hand. And luxation of joynts, and evil coupling of parts, if they riſe of diſtemper onely, that being taken away with medicines, returneth oftentimes with it, good ſituation of parts. Likewiſe, the ſituation perverteth through diſtemper, the complexion being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, the other conſequently do follow. Now, having declared in general the diſeaſes which onely require medicine, that every diſeaſe may have his proper one, I will ſubdivide them more particularly, joyning to every diſeaſe that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine which thereto belongeth. The diſeaſes in the complexion, are either in all the parts of the temper thereof, or in one or twain. In the whole complexion are ſuch as are ingendred of venemous cauſes: and thoſe either ingendred in the body, or happening thereto outwardly; they which are ingendred with age in the body, are Cankers, Leproſies, Falling-ſickneſs, Suffocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:51945:52"/> of the matrix through Nature corrupted, Swounding, through corruption of Worms, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred in the body, and theſe be the diſeaſes of venemous cauſes bred in the body. Such as happen thereto by outward occaſions, are either by poiſon taken into the body, or by outward <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now follow the diſeaſes which are by the exceſs, or defect of one or two parts of the temper, which are hot, cold, moiſt, and dry, ſimple or compounded, which if they be not procured by evil humours, then require they altering onely by contrary qualities. If by them: as Phegm, Choler, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, then are theſe humours firſt to be avoided, and diminiſhed.</p>
                  <p>Such as require altering, are cured by natures of contrary quality, not onely generally, but even anſwerable to all degrees of exceſs. And firſt to begin with hot diſeaſes of the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, they are cured with ſuch contraries as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: Barley, ſower Grapes, Roſes, Violets, the Oak, Quinces, Damſins, Pellitory of the wall, Docks, Pears, Apples, Harts-horn, the flowers, and whole herb of Mallows: of the ſecond degree, the water Lilly, Ducks meat, Knotgraſſe, Vine leaves, the Bramble, Plantane, Cherries, Lead, Cerus, Barberies, Cowcumbers, Mellons, Gourds, Citrals, whites of Eggs, Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and Services.

The third and fourth degrees, as theſe are evil ſupplied by ſtrange ſimples, ſo are they recompenſed by increaſe of quantities of moiſt in the two firſt degrees. And thus much touching medicines belonging to the cure of diſeaſes in one part of the temper, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in two parts, and without humour, require either temperings the ſimple qualities aforeſaid, in divers ſimples, or natures wherein ſuch two do exceed, which becauſe they be as plentiful as thoſe I have before mentioned, and that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of none makes doubt, I will not touch: If this double diſtemper riſe of humour, as for the moſt part it doth, then is that humour to be diminiſhed, or altogether to be voided out of the body, and then the diſtemper remaining to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:51945:56"/> be altered. The humors are properly to be void<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by purgation, otherwiſe there be diverſe: as exerciſe, faſtings, ſweating, urine, and ſuch like. But properly the vacuation of Phlegm, Choler, Melancholly, which are the cauſes of this double diſtemper, belonging to purging medicines, which purgations, as the greateſt doubt is of natures proviſion in them, ſo they being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by our own Countrey Soil, the greateſt part of this controverſie may ſeem to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided.</p>
                  <p>Purgations are either by vomit, or by ſtool: by vomit our native ſoil miniſtreth great choice, as very gently: The Radiſh roots with the ſeed, the Pepon root, and Nettle-ſeed, with more vehemency: Folefoot, leaf and root, the middle bark of the Walnut-tree, and the long bloſſoms thereof: and yet moſt vehemently, the ſeeds of Broom, and the flowers thereof: and theſe for vomit. By the ſtool, and firſt to purge choller: the flowers and leaves of the Peach-tree, Violet flowers and ſeeds, comparable with Rhewbarb, the great garden Dock, called the Munks, Rhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb, Damask-roſes, wilde Saffron, the powder of Fetherfew, all the kinde of ſpurges, the root of the wild Cowcomber, the root of Briony, and Coloquintida. Melancholly is purged with Coloquintida, the Oak Fern, the juice of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drake, the flowers of Broom, Barefoot, and Antimony. Phlegm and water are purged with Coloquintida, the juice of Rhineberries, the groſs bark of the Elm, the juice of the root of Walwort, of Elder, the garden Flowerdeluce
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:51945:56"/> root juiced. The dry leaves of Laurel, the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withwinde, ſcurby weed.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are a ſhow of our Engliſh ſtore of Purgers, which if they be too ſtrong, then are they to be miniſtred in ſmaller quantity, mixed with thoſe of feebler working: if too weak, then are they to be ſharpned with quicker. If they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend any part, they are to be corrected, partly with cordials, and partly with medicines reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting ſuch parts as they annoy. Which wants are not onely to be charged upon our Countrey me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, ſeeing even the beſt of forreign purgers are to be touched with the ſame. As Scammony is corrected with Quinces, otherwiſe it troubleth the ſtomach with a griping and gnawing, it pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth over vehemently, it hurteth the liver, and is an enemy to the heart, and doth exulcerate where it paſſeth, and procureth dyſenteries, that is to ſay, ulcers in the guts. Turpeth is corrected with Ginger, and long Pepper. Maſtick with oil of ſweet Almonds, and Sugar, elſe overthroweth it the ſtomach, troubleth, and overdrieth the body. Coloquintida with oil of ſweet Almonds, Gum, Tragacanth, or Maſtick, elſe troubleth it vehemently the whole body, procureth the bloody Flix, and miſerably tormenteth the guts. So Agarick requireth to be ſteeped in wine with Ginger and Cloves, yet ſcarce abſtaineth it from overthrowing the ſtomach. Caſſia marreth the ſtomach, and requireth to be mixed there with ſtomach medicines. The exceſſive drineſs and binding of Rhewbarb, is corrected with ſome moiſtning ſyrup. Aloe requireth Maſtick and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:51945:57"/> Gum, Tragacanth, to mitigate the fretting thereof. Sene marreth the ſtomach, and either through windineſs, or through vehemency of ſcouring tormenteth the body, and therefore needeth Ginger, Cinamon, or Spike, ſweet Prunes, fat Broth, and Raiſins. Hermodactiles offend the ſtomach, and cauſe winde, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire Ginger, Cumine, or Spike: and to be ſhort, there is no purger of ſtrange drugs, which requireth not correction of great faults; which correction is taken from ſuch medicines as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect thoſe parts chiefly, which the purgation, doth annoy, whereof ſuch is our ſtore, that in all parts we be ſufficiently armed therewith: but of theſe ſhall hereafter be ſpoken.</p>
                  <p>Now if any man think for want of Caſſia, Manna, Sene, Rhewbarb, theſe humors cannot be voided, or not ſo well; let me then know how the Grecians wanted them, and yet found no lack, uſing onely Scammony, Helleborus, and Colocynthis, Aloes, and Agarick, for their chief purgations. The other being brought in of late in compariſon, by the Arabians, who both in knowledge of Phyſick, and in the works thereof were far inferiour to the Grecians, to whom I ſay (I mean the ancient of them in <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens</hi> time, and before) neither Manna, nor Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, nor Sene, nor Rhewbarb, nor Hermodacty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les were known, either at all, or at the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt for purgers: and as for Manna <hi>Fuchſius</hi> ſaith, that certain having been about the mount <hi>Libanus,</hi> made report that the inhabitants of that mountain having eaten their fill thereof,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:51945:57"/> neither feel themſelves any whit troubled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, nor their bodies looſed, but uſe it for an ordinary ſuſtenance: whereby again appeareth a great diverſity of working of ſtrange medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, according to the variety of Countreys. But what ſhould we ſay of the nature of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, it is doubtleſs one of the hardeſt points at this day in all natural Philoſophy; neither minde I at this preſent to deal therein: but this may I ſay, as by preparation, one nature may accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the variety thereof receive divers, yea, contrary vertues, ſo ſeemeth it to me, that this vertue of purging may be procured to natures of themſelves deſtitute thereof, by preparation. Divers, and in a manner all the mettals and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals being burnt and waſhed, give over their fretting nature: And Quickſilver (which of it ſelf is not ſublimed, or precipitated) becometh a vehement ſcouring medicine: ſo likewiſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony, before it be turned into glaſs or oyl, is not known to purge the body, which being done, is greatly commended againſt the Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, the French Pox, Melancholly, and divers other diſeaſes, which it cureth by purging: ſo that it ſeemeth art of preparation, as it maketh no nature, (that being a work of the univerſal nature) ſo may it not onely be a preparer, but even a maker of medicines, which medicines are not natures, as hath been before declared, but qualities in natures, even as health, and ſickneſs are not of the nature of mans body, but even accidents thereto. Which being certain, let us then conſider what an infinite variety of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:51945:58"/> would ariſe of things, the ſame being uſed not onely entire, but diverſly prepared, and even corrupted: wherein the induſtry of <hi>Alchmiſtes,</hi> is verily greatly to be commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and far more excellent then the common <hi>Pharmacopolia,</hi> rather ſo to be called then <hi>Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macopoiya,</hi> by the skill whereof diverſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in one thing are ſo exactly ſevered, every one having a diverſe operation. Now oft-times becauſe the Humour to be purged is groſs and tough, and ſo hardly yieldeth to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, or hath ſome other evil quality, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it might greatly hurt the parts, whereby it paſſeth; Nature not forgetting this point, hath as abundantly ſupplied ſuch helps in this behalf, as need requireth: as for the preparing of Choler; Plantine, Roſes, the Verjuice of the Grape, Endive, Succory, Sorrel, Sperage, &amp;c. For Melancholly; Violets, Borage, Bugloſs, Baulm, Fumitory, Doddar, Ceterach, or Fingerfearn, &amp;c. For Phlegme; Fenel, Parſley, Betony, Nep, Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, Thime, Savory, Germander, &amp;c. Of theſe I leſs ſtand upon, becauſe the preparers of humors are leaſt in controverſie, although from hence may an argument be drawn, not lightly to be paſſed over, to prove the ſtore of purgers, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nature hath miniſtred ſufficiency of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and as it were Harbingers to the purgers of Countrey yield. But I will draw to an end, and thus much ſhall ſuffice for this preſent purpoſe to have bin ſaid of Medicines, belonging to the cure of all Diſeaſes in the Complexion. The other kinde of Diſeaſes are in the frame of the Body,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:51945:58"/> and of thoſe, if quantity be ſuperfluouſly increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and that in the whole body, medicines which do vehemently waſte, as thoſe of the third de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree hot, diminiſh the ſame. If in the part one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, medicines which we call eaters and fretters, diſpatch the ſame: as Copperas, the aſhes of Spurge, burnt Allom, Mercury ſublimed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate, Verdigreece, burnt Salt, &amp;c. If meaſure be diminiſhed, and that without loſs of ſubſtance, the glewing medicines bring cure: whereof our native ſoil is ſo ſtored, that for Wounds, the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons need neither ſend into <hi>Barbary,</hi> nor <hi>India:</hi> as Plantine, Hounds-tongue, the flowers and leafs of Willows, Yarrow, Carduus Benedictus, Betony, Scabious, Verven, Elm-leaves, Adders-tongue, Moon-wort, Herb-turpence, Selfheal; and theſe if the wounds be in the fleſhy parts. If it be breaking of Bones, ſuch are joyned with fine flower, the brain of a Dog, with Wool, and the white of an Egg, the Holilock-root, the moſs of the Oke, Glew, Roſes, Wormwood, &amp;c. If there be loſs of ſubſtance in the fleſhy parts, either by wound, or ulcer, Incarnatives fail us not: as Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley meal, Fenigreek-flower, Figbene-meal; and to be ſhort, all ſuch as be of the firſt degree hot and dry, without eagerneſs or fellneſs. Now the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes in the ſtraitneſs of Paſſages, or Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if they ariſe of the humors aforeſaid, and in thoſe places whereto the medicine may conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently come, then are they to be ſet free by pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging. If upon other cauſes, or in ſuch pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces whereto the force of the medicines which purgeth cannot come, or hardly entereth, or
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:51945:59"/> of ſuch cauſes as be no humours, but through ſome other ſtrange matter, or by ſtraitneſs of the veſſels wherethrough the paſſage is, then are other remedies to be uſed, whereof we have great plenty, as ſoftners, looſers, and ſuch as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the pores of the body; of which ſort are ſuch as be not above the firſt degree hot, as Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momile, Lilies, new Butter, Swines-greaſe, Lin-ſeed, Fenigreek, Briony-root, all Marrows. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Medicines which make the matter thin, or cut it, and divide it into ſundry parts; of which ſort are they of the ſecond degree hot, to the third degree: as Dill, Pennerial, Savery, Organ, Thime, Marjoran, Saint-Johns wort, Worm-wood, &amp;c. Now if the humour prepared be to be voided by place medicine, then Salt, Salt-water, Lye, Aſhes, Allom, and Lime, take place; and if more vehemency be needful, Calamint, wilde Creſſes, Treacle, Muſtard, Garden Creſſes, Muſtard-ſeed, Nettles, Dragons, all the Spurges are to be numbred among the beſt: and if theſe ſerve not, the root of Crowfoot will make the ſupply. If the humour cannot be voided con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently, except it be altered into another mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of which ſort is pent blood out of the veins, then are ripening medicines firſt to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied: as Butter, Wheat-flower, Sorel, Horſe-hoof, Lilies, Marſh-mallows, Onions roaſted; which are all ſingular ripeners. If the matter be tough and clammy, the ſcourers avoid that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience: Endive, Succory, red Roſes, Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, Houſleek, Agrimony, Betony, Honey, Horehound, Wormwood, Baulm, Pimpernel,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:51945:59"/> Watergermander, &amp;c. Now if the matter which ſtoppeth be the ſtone, as in the Kidneys, or Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, then are theſe Medicines moſt convenient for that uſe: Grummel-ſeed, Goats-blood, the juice of Mugwort, Seahulver-root, the ſtones found in the great Snails heads, Radiſh-roots, Saxifrage, &amp;c. If any hard matter be in other parts, the ſoftners, and waſters, and diſſolvers are to be applied. Thus much touching the cure of Obſtructions and ſtrait Paſſages, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the variety of place where they light, cauſe ſundry Diſeaſes, or rather take to them ſundry names: As in the Brain, the Apoplexy; in the bladder of Gall, the yellow Jaundies; in the Spleen, the black; in the Sinnews of moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Palſie or trembling; in the Lungs, Aſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hma, &amp;c. Now if theſe Paſſages be too large, they are to be ſtopped and ſtraitned with cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drying medicines; of which ſort, in a manner, are all of ſharp and ſowre taſte: as Vine leaves, the Bryer and Bramble, Barberries, Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and Services, Quinces, and ſuch as are of themſelves, or by mixture with liquor clammy; as Wheat-flower, Bean-flower, the white of an Egge, Plaiſter, waſhed Lime, Litharge, and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſe. Now moreover, becauſe in all good cure, not onely the cauſe of the Diſeaſes is to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned, but the part alſo to be ſtrengthned, which muſt needs, partly by the cauſe of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and partly even by the conflict of the ſame cauſe with the medicine be feebled, that nothing be wanting unto us for the reſtoring of health, nature hath provided even ſpeciall munition for
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:51945:60"/> every part of the body, that the whole furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture againſt all diſeaſes might be compleat: As for the Head, Anniſeeds, Folefoot, Betony, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamint, Eyebright, Lavander, Bayes, Marjoran, Piony, Sage, Rue, or Herbgrace, Lettice, the Leaves and Flowers of Water-lilies, Roſes, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Nightſhade.

                  <p>Thus have I (gentle Reader) briefly run over the Diſeaſes cured by Medicine, having paſſed by thoſe which either riſe of theſe, as evil figure by immoderate exceſs, or defect of quantity, unequally increaſing or wanting, or number, evil ſituation for want of good couplance
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:51945:60"/> through diſtemper, and ſuch like, as alſo the compound of thoſe which require (onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition excepted) the ſame medicines. Whereby evidently mayeſt thou ſee the goodneſs of God towards thee, in ſo plentifully furniſhing thine own ſoil with ſuch variety of medicines, which if it yield thee ſuch plenty in this neglect, and loathing of our countrey remedies, what fruit were thou to look for, if diligence and pains were uſed? Verily, right well might we both avoid the dangers before declared, eaſe our ſelves of immoderate charge, and have better aſſurance of our medicines then we have: yea, very well ſatisfie our daintineſs, even with ſtrange ſimples, or finde out ſuch as ſhould not onely in vertues match with the ſpices of <hi>India,</hi> (which is a plain caſe) as Roſemary matcheth Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; Baſil, Cloves; Sage, the Nutmegs; Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron, Ginger; Thime, Musk; Savery, the leaf called Malabathrum, but even in pleaſantneſs of taſte expreſs the ſame. And as Avens doth moſt lively repreſent the taſte of Cloves unto us, ſo likely is it, if ſearch were made, and this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe of examining and trying our native ſimples taken in hand by men of wiſdom and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, we ſhould no more be deſtitute of ſpices, then <hi>India</hi> or <hi>Arabia,</hi> although neither Indiſh, nor Arabick: and as the ſmall jags of the roots of Avens fail little from Cloves in taſte, ſo might we as likely finde that which were little inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to Cinnamon, Ginger, Nutmegs, and Mace; not onely in likeneſs of working, but even
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:51945:61"/> in ſimilitude of nature: but I will refer this to that time, when either men ſhall be more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for publique benefit then private gain, or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient allowance beſtowed of ſuch men as ſhould ſpend their dayes onely in ſearching out the vertues of natures, which at this time is greatly wanting, even as for all other profeſſions of arts. Our Engliſh ſoil is greatly commended, as it juſtly deſerveth, for temper of the air, and of ſuch as have experience thereof, of ſtrangers, and great maſters of ſimples, for variety of excellent medicines carrieth great praiſe, who report they finde ſuch ſimples in the valleys and woods of our North parts, as they finde in the tops of mountains in the South Countreys. So that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Gardens in <hi>England,</hi> eſpecially in <hi>London,</hi> are able to afford great variety of medicines, even of forreigh ſimples to all diſeaſes. And if the Dittany of <hi>Candy,</hi> the Cyprus-tree, the Nicotian out of <hi>India,</hi> Coloquintida, the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond-tree, the Pomegranate-tree, will brook our ſoil, and flouriſh therein, as they do, we need not doubt, but certain and ſufficient proviſion of all medicines, I mean all kindes, but not all of every kinde, which were unneceſſary, neither can any Countrey challenge the ſame) might be made partly of a voluntary yield of the ſame, partly by planting, and ſowing with juſt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the mould, and ſituation of the Plant, out of our own Countrey, both with leſs charge, and leſs danger, for all diſeaſes. Now if it be demanded, why then both the practice
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:51945:61"/> is, and hath been hitherto otherwiſe? I will onely ſay thus much for anſwer, although much more might be ſaid. The whole Art of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick hath been taken, partly from the Greeks, and partly from the Arabians, and as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the Art, ſo likewiſe the meanes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, wherewith for the moſt part the precepts of the ſame Art are executed, which hath bred this errour in times paſt; now by a tradition received, that all duty of the Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an touching reſtoring health, is to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the ſame remedies not in kinde one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but even ſpecially, with thoſe which the Grecian and Arabian Maſters uſed, who wrote not for us, but for their Greeks and Arabikes, tempering their medicines to their ſtates, although their rules be as common as reaſon to all nations. <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith in his firſt Book of preſerving health, he giveth the rules thereof no more to Germanes, then to Boars and Bears, but to the Grecians, which declareth they reſpected their own Nation, both in rule and medicine, Who alſo the Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians in the ſame point followed. Now we receiving the ſame medicines with the rule, muſt needs fall into the abſurdities afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, much like to the evil Muſician, which playeth onely upon the inſtrument, whereon his Maſter taught him, which if he aſſay upon another, committeth divers diſcords among other evill graces in Muſick. But the wife and learned Phyſician, being furniſhed with
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:51945:62"/> other Arts more general then his own, whereto natural Philoſophy moſt highly approacheth, being a knowledge of all natural things, not of <hi>Arabia,</hi> or <hi>India,</hi> or <hi>Greece,</hi> but univerſally find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in all countreys medicines for diſeaſes, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture yielding ſufficiency of contraries to all ſorts of them, whereto the inhabitants are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; at the leaſt in all quarters, which riſe not of a blinde tradition, but from a certain knowledge of nature. This then I take to be the chief cauſe of this cuſtom in uſing ſtrange medicines, which ignorance of nature doth feed and nouriſh dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. I blame none, neither tax I any man, and I dare ſay, there is not a learned Phyſician in this Land, who is not able to perform this point with Engliſh medicines, if they would take the matter in hand; whereto rather I exhort them, then inſtruct them, being a thing ſufficiently known unto them. For it is not the Nutmeg, or the Mace that ſtrengthneth the brain, and cureth cold diſeaſes, and moiſt diſeaſes thereof, but a drying and warming vertue, with a ſecret agreement which they have with the brain to preſerve the ſame, which being found as ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in Sage, in Roſemary, in Betony, and ſuch like, the Nutmeg, and the Mace, with ſuch other ſpices for that turn may be diſcharged. The ſame may be ſaid of all ſtrange natures, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we want, yet have we ſuch as are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to ſerve inſtead: for as every nation hath a peculiar condition of the ſame diſeaſe, ſo muſt the medicine alſo needs be of another ſort; and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:51945:62"/> as the medicine varieth, ſo why the matter of the ſame medicine ſhould not alſo vary, I know not. The medicine varieth in reſpect of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of the Patient, being other in one coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, then in another, which medicines is, as it were, ſeated in nature, which hath many quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties beſides that medicinable; which quality, if the medicine be good, muſt agree with the Patients complexion: if not, then hurteth it greatly. If it agreeth with the complexion of a Moor, an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, or Spaniard, then muſt it needs diſagree with ours; which diſagreement and want, if it be patched up unto us by correctours, yet declareth the patching, that the medicine is rather by force conſtrained, then naturally yieldeth it ſelf to the remedy, and ſo of it ſelf unmeet. Wherefore as well the matter thereof is to be changed, as the medicine it ſelf. And if thoſe corrections need alſo correction, what then? I will not ſay that all ſimples need their correctours, although it be avouched of ſome, and ſuch as carry great authority for their skill in Phyſick. Thus have I (gentle Reader) for thy benefit I hope made a way to the greater uſe of our home medicines, wherein if I have ſaid freely my minde againſt ſtrange drugs, thou mayeſt underſtand that otherwiſe the way were ſtopped to our Engliſh medicines; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:51945:63"/> profitable to Engliſh men. Wherein I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of excellent Philoſophers and learned Phyſicians, neither broach I any idle conceits of my own. Of this minde is <hi>Plinius, Secundus, Fuchſius, Rulandus, Symphorianus, Campegius, Octavianus, Horatianus</hi> Phyſician to <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Emperour, that all Countreys have ſufficient medicines for all diſeaſes. I know much more might be ſaid of this point, but this I thought ſufficient.</p>

                     <p>By this we may in part underſtand, with how great vertue, God hath indued, and (as I may ſay) bleſſed this herb. To ſum up all, it helpeth the body inwardly and outwardly; it ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens almoſt all the principall members of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; as the brain, the heart, the ſtomach, the liver, lungs, and kidneys. I may ſay it is a preſervative againſt all diſeaſes; for it provoketh ſweat, by which the body is purged of much corruption which breedeth diſeaſe. It expelleth the venom of infection: it conſumes ill blood, and all naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty humours, whereof diſeaſes are ingendred. Therefore giving God thanks for his goodneſs, which hath given us this Herb, and all other things for the benefit of our health; it will in the next place be convenient to conſider how to make uſe of it in the application.</p>

                     <head>How <hi>Carduus Benedictus</hi> may be taken.</head>
                     <p>It is to be obſerved, that we may uſe this herb, and enjoy the vertues thereof four wayes. Firſt, in the green leaf. Secondly, in the powder. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the juice. And fourthly, in the diſtillation.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:51945:66"/> The green leaf may be taken with bread and butter, as we uſe to take Sage and Parſley in a morning to breakfaſt. And if it be too bitter, it may be taken with honey inſtead of butter. It may be taken in pottage boiled among other herbs: and being ſhred ſmall, it may be drunk with Ale, Beer, or Wine. It is ſometims given in Beer with <hi>aqua compoſita,</hi> and that without harm, when the ſtomach of the patient is weak, and he not troubled with any hot diſeaſe. The juice of it is either outwardly applied; the leaf, powder, and water of it, is received in the mouth.</p>
                     <p>It may be taken in Pottage alſo in the green leaf, or with Wine; which if it be burned and drunk hot, it is the better. If you pleaſe, you may boil it with Wine, and honey or ſuger to make it ſweet, and then drink it very warm.</p>
                     <p>The powder may be taken with honey upon a knives point, or with bread and honey if you pleaſe; or elſe it may be drunk with Ale, Beer, or Wine. The diſtilled water may be drunk by it ſelf alone, or elſe with white Wine before meat, or with Sack after meat, eſpecially if the ſtomach be weak and cold.</p>
                     <p>The liquor or broth in the which this herb is boiled, may be made thus. Take a quart of running water, ſeethe it and ſcum it, then put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it a good handful of the herb, and let it boil until the better part of the liquor be conſumed: then drink it with wine, or if you think fit with honey or ſuger, to make it more pleaſant in the taſte. Or elſe make a Potion thus: Take a good handfull of the leaves, with a handfull
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:51945:67"/> of Raiſins of the Sun, waſhed and ſtoned, and ſome Sugarcandy, and Licorice ſliced ſmall, boil them all together in a quart of Water, Ale, or Wine: If it be too bitter, it may be made ſweet, as is aforeſaid,</p>
                     <p>It is alſo to be obſerved, that the Powder and Water of the Herb is moſt to be regarded, and ſpecially the water: For they may be long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, ſo that one may have them alwayes in a readineſs to uſe, as need ſhall require, when a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> the juice cannot be had, nor the green leaf. And the Water (which onely is void of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) may be drunk by it ſelf alone: for the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and taſte will bear it, and like of it as well as of Roſe-water. Notwithſtandig, if the ſeed be ſown as ſoon as it is ripe, one may have the Herb both winter and ſummer, from the time that it beginneth to grow, until the ſeed wax ripe again. Therefore I councel all them that have Gardens, to nouriſh it, that they may have it alwayes for their own uſe, and the uſe of their Neighbours that ſtand in need of it.</p>

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:51945:70"/> I conclude, that foraſmuch as Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God is good unto all men, we ought to be like minded, and not to keep ſecret, nor to hide any thing that may profit one another. I wiſh all men rightly to uſe the good creatures of God, and to give him hearty thanks for all his benefits.</p>

                     <p>THe Errors which are uſed at this preſent (touching the Venerian Diſeaſe) are very great, but chiefly at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; for when it firſt breaks forth, it appeareth in the Yard with inflamation, ulcers, and excoriation of the conduct of the Urine, which cometh from the neck of the Bladder: and after that commonly followeth Apoſthumes of the Groins, with Puſhes, and ſuch other like diſcoloured Pimples, according to the infected humour; for the cure of the which, unskilful perſons begin with vehement or ſtrong Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines; as <hi>Colocinthis,</hi> Confection of <hi>Hamech,</hi> or ſuch like. And the next day they open a Vein
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:51945:126"/> in the right or left arm, (reſpecting not that there may follow a lask of their vehement Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation) and then miniſter their unctions, and ſuffumigations, which is certainly a manifeſt Errour.</p>
                     <p>By the which means they draw the infectious blood and humors to the noble parts, and feeling the inward anoyance of the ſame, ſendeth it to divers outward parts of the body. The which doth ingender hard tumors, as knots and kernels not eaſily curable, and moſt ſharp and fretting (rebellions againſt curation) botches, with ſuch other like.</p>
                     <p>And ſo by the maliciouſneſs of the humour, it corrupteth and eateth the bone with ſuch pains and torments, that the poor Patients are ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, that they know not where to reſt; and eſpecially more in the night, then in the day. Therefore at this preſent I have thought good, according to my little skill, to teach a Method for to bring theſe errours into a perfect order.</p>
                     <p>At the beginning of this contagious Diſeaſe, you ſhall firſt begin this curation by evacuating of the body with gentle Lenitives, which do both cool the boiling rage of the blood; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo make it thinner in mundifying the blood: this muſt be uſed according to the temperature of the Body.</p>
                     <p>The which ſhall be done after that the body is prepared, to the end that the ſolutives may the better work upon the aforeſaid humors. For in this caſe, nature muſt rule the Chyrurgeon, and not the Chyrurgeon nature. Then after that,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:51945:126"/> it is neceſſary and profitable to open the Anckle vein, in the right or left foot, according as the Apoſtume doth appear; and if there be no Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtume, according to the diſcretion of the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chyrurgeon: this done, you divert or pull back the aforeſaid infectious humors from the principal parts. And upon the Apoſtume, you ſhall apply continually mollifying and drawing Medicines, in doing what may be to bring him to ſuppuration. This Indications be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accompliſhed, you ſhall uſe of the potion made with <hi>Ebenum</hi> and <hi>Guaiacum,</hi> prepared ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the temperature of the humors, which ſhall be uſed the ſpace of a moneth or thereabouts.</p>
                     <p>And although that ſome learned men have an opinion, that the decoction of <hi>Guaiacum</hi> ought to be uſed without any other Medicines, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs it hath been found by experience, that the uſe of other ſimples with it, (being fit and agreeing to the diſeaſes) hath a great deal more profited, and been found of better effect then if it had been miniſtred alone; for in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound diſeaſe a ſimple remedy is not requiſite.</p>
                     <p>Although that <hi>Alphonſus Ferrus</hi> hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to the contrary; the which <hi>Alphonſus</hi> uſeth this decoction of the Wood in a manner to all diſeaſes; (whoſe opinion is not to be followed) which decoction is uſed in <hi>Phtiſi. etiam ſi dies placuerit in ſenio Philippi.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Moreover they have greatly erred, which have ſet forth the <hi>Radix Chini,</hi> being a root very dear, unprofitable, and altogether without taſte,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:51945:127"/> and the greateſt error of all is committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, which have brought in uſe, the diet of the decoction of Box-tree, which is an Aſtringant wood ſtinking, and an enemy to all the principal parts. And if you will have a wood which is moſt agreeable to the <hi>Guaia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum;</hi> you ſhall uſe of <hi>Fraximus,</hi> the which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth obſtructions of the Liver, of the Milt and of the Reins; for I have known many which by the uſe thereof have recovered their health.</p>

                     <head>The ſecond error touching the ſaid diſeaſe when it cometh to ſuppuration.</head>
                     <p>WHen this diſeaſe hath been once taken in hand and evil handled, either by Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Chirurgeon or the negligence of the Patient. The common Chyrurgeons uſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly new errors; that is, with giving ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives without preparing of the evil humors. By the which means, they take away the beſt and leave the worſt behinde, whereof ingendreth Nodes, old and Cankerd ſores, and ſuch like. Then they (as evil or rather worſe) apply their Unctions or Suffumigations before that the Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers be made clean or the Nodes taken away, and ſometimes leave the Bone foul. By the which means, they purchaſe to themſelves both ſhame and infamy; for within four or five moneths the Ulcers open with great corruption of the Bone.</p>
                     <p>Moreover they commit an errour touching the Unction, for they anoint the Head, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:51945:127"/> of the Heart, and other noble parts, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all reaſon: and alſo all the whole body over, which is the occaſion of many a mans death.</p>
                     <p>Therefore to amend theſe errors (when you ſee that this diſeaſe is confirmed, and that there are hard Ulcers, hard Swelling, or Nodes) it is the moſt ſureſt way to mundifie the ſaid Ulcers, and to open the Nodes with acauſtick; then you ſhall make inciſion in the Node unto the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Bone, and then apply <hi>Praecipitatum,</hi> or elſe Pledgets with <hi>Baſilicon</hi> and <hi>Praecipitatum</hi> mingled together: this done, you ſhall take away the corruption of the bone.</p>
                     <p>And then after that you may ſafely uſe your Unctions made with <hi>Axungia</hi> Gummes, <hi>Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,</hi> Oyles and <hi>Mercury;</hi> alſo if you adde there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to of fine Treacle or <hi>Mithridatum,</hi> it will be the better.</p>
                     <p>You ſhall anoint the Shoulders, the Muſcles of the Back, the Loins, the Hips, the Thighs, the Knees, and all the outward members, as Legs, and Arms.</p>
                     <p>But you muſt take very good heed that you touch not the Head, the Region of the Heart, the Somach, nor the ridge of the Back. Alſo you muſt have a good reſpect to ceaſe your anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſuch order, that you bring not too many accidents to the mouth, whereby the Patient may utterly loſe the uſe both of his Tongue and Teeth.</p>
                     <p>Becauſe that ſo many ignorant Chyrurgeons, have taken upon them this cure (without either
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:51945:128"/> diſcretion in applying the Unction, or ordering of the Patient) I have thought good to write two or three words touching the ordering of the Patient.</p>
                     <p>When the body is prepared with apt and meet Medicines, as well Syrrups, Decoctions, Purgings, and opening of the Vein according to the diſpoſition of the body, the Patient ſhall be placed in a place naturally hot or elſe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe made warme, which muſt be free from all cold; having the doors, windows, and other open places cloſely ſtopt; for the cold Air is very hurtful both for the Sinewie parts, and alſo for the working of Medicines; for it will diminiſh and hinder the actions thereof. And in this caſe there are many which commit great errors, which are worthy of reprehenſion; for as well in the Winter as in the Summer, they anoint the Patients in great and large Chambers where very much Air entreth.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore at the beginning of this cure (if the place be not very cloſe and warm) you ſhall make a Pavilion with Coverings, and ſuch other like, round about a fire; by the which means you ſhall keep the cold Air from the Patient. But if it be poſſible, it is better to have a little Chamber cloſe and warm, and alſo continually a pan with Coles in the midſt of it.</p>
                     <p>If it be ſo that the Patients be ſo weak that they cannot abide the heat of the fire, or would be loath to be ſeen naked, (as Women or Maids) you ſhall anoint them lying in their Beds, Firſt the Patient ſhall put out one Arm, and then the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:51945:128"/> other; and ſo the reſt of the parts ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed one after another. And you ſhall uſe the Patients from time to time, to ſuch a courſe as is required againſt the diſeaſe.</p>

                     <p>Wherefore when you ſee that the Wound pierceth into the <hi>Thorax,</hi> or Breaſt, you ſhall take good adviſement, in ſearching out dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, whether the Blood be deſcended into the lower part of the <hi>Diaphragma;</hi> the which may be known by the ſtinking of the Breath, and by the relation of the Patient, which doth feel the Blood quivering or ſhaking inwardly: And alſo commonly his face will be of a reddiſh or high colour, by reaſon of the Vapors which aſcend up.</p>
                     <p>And note that at the which ſide the blood

                     <p>IN the fractures of the Scull, there are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted great errors touching the application of the <hi>Traepan,</hi> principally when the bone is broken in many parts; for they have no conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the ſhivering of the Scull, but apply the <hi>Traepan,</hi> by the which means they preſs down the ſhivers of the bone upon the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> and rent or tear it in ſuch order, that it produceth grievous accidents, whereby com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly death enſueth. Wherefore in this caſe, you ſhall have a good conſideration before that you apply the <hi>Traepan;</hi> for it is better (if it be poſſible) in this caſe to uſe other Inſtruments, as Eleviatories, Ciſers, <hi>Lenticuli,</hi> or ſuch other like, to make way for the bruiſed matter which depreſſeth the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> it ſhall be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and leſs danger for the Patient.

                     <p>Moreover there be many ignorant Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, which without conſideration apply the <hi>Traepan</hi> upon all parts of the Head, as well upon the comiſtures, or ſeams, as other places; which is the cauſe of the death of many Patients.</p>

                     <p>Foraſmuch as their application doth moiſten too much the nervous places, and retaineth or keepeth in the matter which is already come to the place; and if there be any Apoſthume, it doth augment and encreaſe it, and cauſeth the matter to aſcend up to the Brain, whereby enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueth Convulſions or Death.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore to avoid this danger, and to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the cure methodically, you ſhall have firſt a regard to the evacuation of the body; and if the ſtrength of the Patient be good, to uſe <hi>Flebeto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice Revolſive,</hi> or according to the cauſe of the grief.

                  <p>I Muſt acknowledge that in my Judgement, I do in general, as concerning the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Urine concur with learned Dr. <hi>Read;</hi> but not ſo, as in ſome particularly, evident, and remarkable diſtempers wholly to ſlight the Urinals Propheſie: I ſhall therefore onely ſet down ſome uſeful Obſervations, and refer them to the Cenſure of ſober and ſerious Practitioners. Urine is the clearer and lighter part of Blood proceeding from the Reins, which if endeavoured to be ſuppreſſed, cauſes the Chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick or Stone. At the firſt evacuation moſt Urines appear thin ſo long as they retain any heat, which whileſt it prevails, ſuffers not the Urine to grow thick, or congeals. Sometimes the Patients Urine comes thicker from him, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards clearer. Some remain ſtill as they were made: thoſe that have Urine clear, will ſoon collect that which is thick into the bottom of the Urinal: Others remain troubled, the groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs notwithſtanding gath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>red in the bottom,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:51945:139"/> inſomuch that theſe diverſities of thin and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle humours ought to be perceived of things conceived in the Urine. Some deſcend to the bottom, called in the Greek, <hi>Hypoſtaſis,</hi> in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh the Grounds, which if white riſing up from the bottom like a pear, ſignifie health; if of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other colour, ſome diſtemper: if like things are ſeen in the middle of the Urinal, they are called ſublutions: if they approach to the higheſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the Urine, they are in Latine called <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilae,</hi> in Engliſh Clouds; the grounds and reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences imperfect, like little red Vetches, in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine called <hi>Orobea:</hi> ſome like to Bran of ground Wheat ſevered from the Meal, in Latine called <hi>Furfurea.</hi> Other Urines reſemble Plates, having breadth without thickneſs, in Latine called <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minea:</hi> ſome are more like to Meal, Wheat, or Barley, in the Latine called <hi>Similacea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are ſometimes diſcerned in the Urine things that reſemble white heats, ſome longer, ſome ſhorter; ſome like to Rugs almoſt red: there is alſo ſometimes ſeen in the uppermoſt part of the Urine a foam or a froath in bells or bubbles: ſometimes there ſwims in the Urine the reſemblance of a Cobweb; at other times there is about the Circle, as it were the renting of Cloth, or the reſemblances of the Motes of the Sun, things like the corruption of a Sore, or the maſculine ſeed; ſometimes gravel or ſand: in theſe there may be divers colours, ſome white, ſome red, ſome yellow, ſome gray, ſome black. Theſe Colours muſt be ſtrictly obſerved, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will undertake from them a confident deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:51945:140"/> of the Sickneſs. I refer all theſe to the judgement of wiſe perſons, what ſubtilty and cures in ſuch niceties ought to be uſed.</p>
                  <p>There is for this purpoſe to be conſidered, that judgement may not be wanting; firſt whether the Ordure be thin, or very thick, what other matter iſſueth out with it, what colour it is of, what the ſavor is, how little, or how ſtrong, how eaſie, or how painful. Secondly, the ſweat, what colour it is of, of what ſmell, whether the taſte be ſalt, bitter, ſower, or unſavory. Thirdly, the evacuation of it be of one colour, or of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; if it doth ſmell very ſtrong, what humor it did moſt abound with, whether faſting, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-meals, painful or eaſie. Fourthly, whether the Spittle is thick or thin, mixt with blood, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt like the humor iſſuing out at the Noſe; and if that be blood, whether it be red, watry, or black. Laſtly, it is to be obſerved what the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et of the Patient hath been before, as alſo in his ſickneſs, his age, the ſtrength of his body, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and the air he lives in, where he continued longeſt in his youthful years, whether in high or low, watry or dry, hot or cold Countreys; theſe generals might ſuffice. I ſhall conclude for the Students better ſatisfaction with ſome other, from time to time, retained tradition, which in my judgement ſome of them are worthy of ſerious conſideration, White Urine ſignifies rawneſs and indigeſtion of the Stomach; red, heat; thick like Puddle, exceſſive labour or ſickneſs; white or red gravel appearing in the bottom of the Urinal, threatens the Stone in the Reins; black
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:51945:140"/> or green coloured Urine, is ominous, commonly ſignifying death.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> For the falling out of the Fundament.</head>
                     <p>THe cauſe of falling out of the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is weakneſs, or relaxation of the Sphineter Muſcle; and therefore the cure muſt be by ſuch Medicines as dry and binde.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A Poltiſs made with Pear-tree-leaves, and applied to the place, is very good.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But firſt you muſt put the Fundament up into its right place again with a warm cloth,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:51945:143"/> which may be done without much trouble, if it have not been long out.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. If it have been long out, many times there follows inflamations and ſwellings; and then it is very difficult to put it up in its right place again; yea, impoſſible before the ſwelling be taken away.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. In ſuch a caſe you muſt bathe the place with Oyl of Roſes warm, or with Oyl of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momile, or with the decoction of Cammomile, if the inflamation be not great.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. If the inflamation be great, you may make a Poltiſs of Chickweed, and Mallows, and Endive, and Succory, with ſome Malt-flour to make it thick, and Sheeps-ſuet to make it moiſt, and that will allay the inflamation in four and twenty hours time; then you may put it up again into its proper place.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Having put it up again into its place, ſtrew upon the place the Powder of burnt Harts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. A Poltiſs made of the leaves of Roſema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and applied to the place, is exceeding good.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. To burn Greek Pitch in a cloſe ſtool whilſt the diſeaſed party ſits over the ſmoak of it, is an approved cure.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. All ſuch things as are dry and binding, are naturally medicinal for the diſeaſe, amongſt which Sinckfoil, Biſtort, and Tormentil are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good.</p>

                     <p n="2">2 Sage conſtantly eaten is a mighty great ſtrengthner of the Liver, inferiour to no Herb growing.</p>

                     <p>IN the beginning, the Dropſie may eaſily be cured, by drinking but the Decoction of Endive, and eating the boyled Herb for a Sallet.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Ribwort boyled and the Decoction drunk, helpeth thoſe that have the Dropſie,</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Alſo a Plaiſter made of Plantane and Rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort, or a Poltis made of the ſame, with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Barley-meal and Vinegar; if withal you exerciſe your body much, and apply this to the Region of the Liver, you ſhall finde it an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent cure.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Fill a Pot almoſt full with the Juyce of Plantane, and binde a Linnen cloth over the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:51945:144"/> Pot, and upon the Linnen cloth put wood-aſhes; in that manner ſet it over the fire, and let it boyl till half be conſumed, ſtrain out what remains unconſumed; and give three or four ſpoonfulls of it every morning to them that are afflicted with the Dropſie, and you ſhall ſee the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful effects of it.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Goats blood dried on the fire, and a drachm of it given at a time in the morning, in any convenient Liquor, will ſoon help the Dropſie.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 Take the Juyce of white Briony Roots, and mix it with its double weight of Honey; 'tis an excellent Purge for ſuch as have the Dropſie, but give not too much at a time.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 The Bark of the Root of an Elder-tree is a very good remedy for the Dropſie; being boyled in Water, and the Decoction drunk: and yet in all probability the Bark of the Root of Dwarf Elder is better then it: if you cannot with convenience get the Bark of the Root, take the Bark of the Branches; there cannot be much difference, if there be any at all.</p>
                     <p n="8">8 Muſtard-ſeed dried and beaten into pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, a drachm of it taken every morning in good Wine helpeth the Dropſie; it is a gentle reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and uſually ſure: yet this is certain, one remedy will not cure one diſeaſe in all Bodies; if it would, there need be but one remedy for one Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p n="9">9 Hyſſop boyled in Wine, and the Decoction drunk, not onely cureth the Hidropical hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, but alſo hindreth them that they cannot ingender again.</p>

The ſpeedy and quaint way to cure the Dropſie, is to let the Patient drink every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſpoonful of the Piſs of a Black Goat; if you cannot with convenience get a Black Goat, get a Black Sheep and let him drink a ſpoonful of his piſs in the Decoction of Spikenard.</p>

                     <p>THe cauſe of the Stone either in the Kidneys or Bladder, is the heat of either part; which hardneth the groſs ſlimy ſubſtance into a Stone.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Goats Blood dried, and beaten into pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, being taken inwardly is a very good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The powder of Burnt Graſhoppers is alſo very Good.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 If the Region of the Bladder be anointed often with the Blood of a Fox, the Stone will break incontinently, as appears; for if you put a Stone into the Blood of a Fox, it will break in three dayes time.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 And here take notice by the way, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times people in avoiding gravel have ſome great Stone ſtick by the way in the paſſage of the Yard, which is many times forced to be taken out by cutting: in ſuch a caſe, if the party did but hold his Yard in the warm Blood of a Fox, it would in a ſhort time be made ſmall enough to come out of it ſelf, without any ſuch troubleſome or painful remedy.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 And although it is very probable, the Blood of a Fox is not alwayes at preſent to be had; yet it may be dried and kept for uſe, whereby it may be alwayes had at preſent; and may be diſſolved in any convenient Liquor when there is need of its uſe; and of all Liquors, I ſuppoſe Vinegar to be the beſt, becauſe of its piercing quality</p>
                     <p n="7">
                        <pb n="237" facs="tcp:51945:146"/>7 Take nine Ivy berries and beat them into powder, and give them to drink in warme White Wine; they wonderfully cleanſe the Kidneys and bladder of Gravel, and provoke Urine exceedingly.</p>
                     <p n="8">8 Take all the blood and the whole skin of a Hare, put them into a new pot that hath a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; lute it up cloſe, and burn it in the fire to aſhes; the Hares skin, and blood I mean, and not the pot: Give the Patient a ſmall ſpoonful of theſe aſhes in White Wine; it mightily breaks and drives out the Stone.</p>
                     <p n="9">9 The Stone that hath been taken out of a man, or the Gravel which men void, being taken back again inwardly, a drachm at a time, doth wonderfully break and bring away the Stone, and is indeed the moſt exquiſite remedy that I know.</p>
                     <p n="10">10 A Tode-ſtone being beaten into powder, and a little of the powder given to the Patient; cauſeth the Stone incontinently to break and come away.</p>
                     <p n="11">11 Take Snails, dry them to powder, ſlime, and ſhells and all; you ſhall finde it a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite remedy, being taken inwardly, to break the ſtone.</p>
                     <p n="12">12 Egg-ſhells dryed and beaten into powder, is a good remedy; and ſo is the Juyce of Mug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort, if you drink the quantity of a quarter of a pint in the morning faſting.</p>
                     <p n="13">13 The Gum of Cherry-trees, and alſo of all Plum-trees, being diſſolved in White Wine and drunk, breaketh the Stone, and cleanſeth
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:51945:147"/> the Kidneys and Bladder of Gravel.</p>
                     <p n="14">14 Take of Goats Blood, the Liver, Lungs, Reins, Yard, and Stones of the Goat; make puddings thereof in the great Gut of the ſaid Goat; order them well and boyl them as you do Hogs puddings; and let him that is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the Stone eat them as meat, not as Medicine; their wonderful effects in breaking the Stone will be admirable in your eyes.</p>
                     <p n="15">15 Sometimes it is a difficult matter to know whether the Stone be in the Reins or in the Bladder; in ſuch a caſe, thus do: take a handful of Chickweed, and boyl it well in water, then ſtrain it out, and apply it to the neck of the Bladder; if the grief increaſe, the Stone is in the Bladder, elſe not.</p>
                     <p n="16">16 Goats piſs drunk, breaketh and expelleth the Stone.</p>
                     <p n="17">17 Take two or three young Liverets, drown them in Vinegar, that they may dye there; then put them into a new pot, lute them up cloſe, and burn them in the fire to aſhes; theſe aſhes taken inwardly is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent remedy for the Stone.</p>
                     <p n="18">18 If a man that is ſubject to the Stone would uſe himſelf to eat no other food, but the fleſh of Foxes; and anoint the Region of his Bladder with the greaſe of the ſame beaſt, it would in a ſhort time cure him.</p>
                     <p n="19">19 A Hedge Sparrow, the feathers pulled off, and the guts pulled out, and the body con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into Mummy, or elſe ſalted and eaten raw, is an excellent remedy for the Stone.</p>
                     <p n="20">
                        <pb n="239" facs="tcp:51945:147"/>20 It is an excellent good way to break the Stone, often to anoint the Region of the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with a ſtrong Spirit of Camomile, drawn in Allembick.</p>
                     <p n="21">21 <hi>Lignum Aphrituum</hi> cut in ſmall pieces and infuſed in ſtrong ſpirit of Wine, (the longer you infuſe it, the better) make an excellent good drink for ſuch as have the ſtone; provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded you drink it but moderately.</p>
                     <p n="22">22 But <hi>Lapis Nephriticus</hi> is far better, being either born about one, and beaten into powder, and given inwardly; whereby it appears, that there is far more vertue in the Mineral king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, then there is in the Vegitable: the Stone is very ſcarce to be had in <hi>London,</hi> if it be to be had at all; becauſe it is never uſed by the neglect of our Colledge of Phyſicians.</p>

                     <p>IN the Strangury, the Urine comes away by drops with much pain; with a great deſire to piſs.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Ox dung mixed with honey, and applied warm to the neck of the Bladder, is very good,</p>

                     <p n="4">4 The neck of the Bladder anointed with the greaſe of a Hedge-hog, is exceeding good to open the ſtoppage of Urine.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 And here by the way, give me leave to quote one experience of my own, though it be ſomething out of courſe; not a year before the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:51945:148"/> writing of this, I had a Patient who had layen a long time ſick of the Stone; I gave him the water of a Hedge-hog, diſtilled in an Alembick, ſo much of it as I had, which was about a pint; of which he took a quarter of a pint every morning: during the time he took it, the violence of his pain ceaſed, and he avoided ſuch an incredible deal of Gravel, which was wonderful to behold: but that being gone, no more to be had, nor &amp; to be procured by reaſon of the ſeaſon of the year, his pains returned: and not long after followed his diſſolution; being open'd, there was two great ſtones found in his body, in each Kidney one.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 Apply Galbanum, being ſpread upon a Plaiſter, upon the Belly, under the Navel. My Author ſaith, it cauſeth the Patient to make Urine preſently; any that pleaſe may try it, I can give no reaſon for it.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 Raddiſh-roots ſcraped clean, and ſliced thin, and infuſed all night in White Wine, and ſtopped cloſe, and a quarter of a pinte taken the next morning, is a mighty great provoker of Urine, but it hath no very pleaſing taſte.</p>
                     <p n="8">8 Herbs that are held Medicinal for this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe are Fennel, Parſley, Gromwel, and Saxifrage, both Seeds, Leaves, and Roots; the Leaves and Bark of Hazel, and the Leaves of Plantane.</p>
                     <p n="9">9 Warm Eggs applied to the neck of the Bladder, wonderfully provoke Urine.</p>
                     <p n="10">10 The Roots of Filupendula, being dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and beaten to powder, and taken inwardly are excellent good for the Strangury: It is called Drop-wort, whether it be becauſe
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:51945:148"/> it cures them that piſs by drops, or becauſe the roots hang like drops by ſmall ſtrings, it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not; the one is their vertue, the other ſhews that it is ſo.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. The beſt remedy in the world againſt the Strangury, is this; to ſave all the water the diſeaſed party maketh, and let the diſeaſed party drink it down back again, and that in very few dayes will cure him.</p>

                     <p>WHether the cauſe of this diſeaſe be the immoderate attraction of the Reins, or the weakneſs of the Sphinater Muſcle of the Bladder, or both of them, we will not diſpute the point out here; howſoever this is certain, there follows as well great thirſt, as piſſing againſt ones will.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Againſt this diſeaſe give the Patient the Bladder of a Goat, or of a black Sheep, or elſe of a Bull beaten into powder; let him drink half a dram of it in any convenient liquor at night going to bed.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. I ſuppoſe the Sphinater Muſcle of the Bladder were ſufficient, if it were converted into Mummy, and beaten into powder; for it will be found to be a very difficult thing to beat the whole Bladder into powder; beſides it is the Sphinater Muſcle which is in fault in our Bladder; therefore if that onely of the Sheeps or Goats Bladder be uſed, the Remedy is agreeable to the Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p n="4">4.

My own Childe was troubled with this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe when very young, whom I cured with theſe remedies; Firſt I got Alehoof, and chopped it very ſmall, but waſhed it not, and having ſprinkled it with ſtrong white Wine Vinegar, applied to her Wreſts.</p>
                     <p>Then I took three Holly-leaves, the fulleſt of prickles I could get, and boiled them in her drink: Theſe medicines I learned of an Italian, which indeed cured her.</p>

The powder of Calamint works very vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently upon the Feminine parts, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a dram of it taken in white Wine every morning, is a very probable remedy to provoke them; onely have a ſpecial care you give it not to women with childe, becauſe it deſtroyes the fruit of her Womb.</p>

                     <head>Of Diet.</head>
                     <p>BY Diet is to be underſtood the miniſtring of Meat and Drink, according to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed natural ordering of it for the ſubſtance and temperature; an exact order of it in labour, Meat, Drink, Sleep, and Venery.</p>
                     <p>There is none, but if they rightly underſtand themſelves, but may in ſome reſpects be their own Phyſicians, if they will but rightly conſider of thoſe things that may do them good, and reſtrain their Appetites from thoſe which are hurtful. For the latter, as touching thoſe things that are to be avoided, I ſhall amongſt others briefly adviſe them to beware of Care, Grief, Penſiveneſs, Anger, of Surfeits, and of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery; to keep good hours, not to break the uſual cuſtome of their ſleeps in the night; not to perplex themſelves with with too much worldly buſineſs, which brings on age and death. For refreſhments, to waſh their hands, and comb often, and every morning to plunge their eyes in cold water; keep the feet dry, and ſometimes waſh them, that they may not be too hot or cold, but in a good temper; keep the head and the neck in the ſame indifferent moderation; but more eſpecially to be ſure to abſtain from too much Venery, which ſhortens life. Other particular di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for diet follow in their order; I ſhall only inſtance ſome few heads, and refer the diligent
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:51945:168"/> Student to the other two Doctors, of Reaſon and Experience, where this Theam throughout forty three Diſeaſes is briefly, but ſufficiently diſcourſed of.</p>

Wherefore they muſt abſtain to eat inordinately of Fruits, Herbs, and Roots, as Garlick, Onions, and Leeks; they muſt refrain from eating of old fleſh, of the brains of beaſts, the Udders of Kine. They muſt uſe moderate ſleep and diet, or elſe they will be too fat and groſs. Fiſh of muddy water are not good for them; and if blood do abound, cleanſe it with Stuffs, or by Phlebotomy.</p>

                     <head>Of Exerciſe.</head>
                     <p>FRom Exerciſe proceeds two great convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the evacuation of Excrements, and keeping the body in a good habit; Exerciſe being a vehement motion, hardens the members, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the heat, cauſeth digeſtion, a quick alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and better nouriſhment, opens the Pores of the body, and cleanſes them; it is ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for health, that where Exerciſe is wanting, Sickneſs will enſue. Learned Writers affirm, that nothing more dulls the body, then ſluggiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; nothing more ſtrengthens it, then labour: notwithſtanding for the management of Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, ſome conſiderations are to be entertained; the time of Exerciſe, that it is not when the body is repleniſhed with Diet not ſufficiently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted. <hi>Gallen</hi> ſayes, that the beſt time for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, is when the firſt and ſecond digeſtions are compleated, as well in the Stomach, as in the Veins, otherwiſe the body is ſubject to crude hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, and yellow choller: the knowledge of this time may be perceived by the colour of the Urine; for that Urine which reſembles clear water, ſignifies that the juyce which comes from
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:51945:170"/> the Stomach is crude in the Veins; that which is well coloured, neither too high nor too low, ſignifies that the ſecond digeſtion is perfected; when the colour is very high or red, it betokens that the concoction is more then ſuffices; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the Urine appears in a temperate co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, neither red nor pale, but as it were gilt, then ſhould Exerciſe have its beginning.</p>

                  <div type="practice">
                     <head>Of Sleep.</head>
                     <p>THe commodity of moderate Sleep appears; that the natural heat, which is occupied about the natural heat whereof nouriſhment proceeds, is comforted in the places of digeſtion; and ſo digeſtion is helpt and bettered by Sleep, the minde rendred more quiet and clear, and the humors more temperate: the moderation of Sleep muſt be meaſured by health or ſickneſs, by age or time, by emptineſs or fulneſs, or by the natural complexion. Phlegmatick perſons are naturally inclined to Sleep, becauſe they ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der many humors. Weak ſtomachs that digeſt ſlowly, are diſquieted of their reſt. Sleep immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after meat, is not wholeſome; immoderate Sleep expoſes the body to many diſeaſes, heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the body and eyes; and a ſavour of the meat before eaten, ſignifies that the Sleep was not ſufficient. It is moſt wholeſome to ſleep on the right ſide, that the meat may approach to the Liver, which is to the Stomach, as fire is to the pot, by it digeſted; it is good for thoſe that have weak ſtomachs to ſleep on their bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies:
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:51945:170"/> Lying on the back is very unwholeſome: unqueſtionably moderate Sleep ſtrengthens all the ſpirits, comforts the body, quiets the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors and pulſes, qualifies the heat of the Liver, is good againſt melancholly. On the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, immoderate Sleep makes the brain giddy, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genders Rhume, Apoſthumes, cauſeth the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, Oblivion, and troubles the ſpirits. Seven hours ſleep is ſufficient for Chollerick and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine men; nine hours for Phlegmatick and Melancholly: thoſe that ſleep longer, deſerve to be ſick of the Lethargy,: In caſes of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to procure ſleep, take a little Camphire min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with ſome womans Milk, and anoint the Temples. Otherwiſe, Take an ounce of the Oyl of Roſes, and three drams of Vinegar, and ſtir them both together, and uſe them: Or elſe take <hi>Gallens</hi> Medicine, who had got ſuch a habit of watchfulneſs by his over much ſtudy in his youth, that he was forced to eat boiled Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice with a little Butter, when he was old, after Supper.</p>

                     <p>THis kinde of Excrement is common to all living Creatures, as well Beaſts as Men; for which cauſe Nature, as a wiſe Mother, hath provided that every concoction hath its excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or ſuperfluity; the Stomach ſends out dung; the Liver Urine, the Veins Sweat; ſo after the third and laſt concoction, which is done in every part of the body that is nouriſhed, there
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:51945:171"/> is left ſome profitable blood reſerved by Nature for Procreation, which blood we call the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative Seed; the timely evacuation whereof avails much for the bodies health: for by it the body is made light and disburthened of Phlegm, and other ſuperfluous humors, which otherwiſe would wax rank, as may be obſerved in ancient Maids, and ſome chaſte Schollers; for beſides their ſecret flames, and imbridled affections which diſpoſe their mindes to extravigant ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, we ſee them alſo ill complexioned, by reaſon of ſuch vaporous fumes which aſcend up towards their cloudy brains. To paſs over other inconveniences they are ſubject to, as the Green-ſickneſs, the Night-mare, the Spleen, the palpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and trembling of the heart, and their pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted dreams; the beſt advice I can give ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, is to marry in the fear of God, and chiefly thoſe are required who are Sanguine or lean; for ſuch perſons abound with blood. Phyſicians hold the Winter to be the beſt time for Carnal Copulation, and in the Spring-time, when Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is deſirous, without the help of Arts and Drugs; and at night when the ſtomach is full, and the body ſomewhat warm, that ſleep imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after it may lenifie the Laſſitude cauſed through the action thereof.

Water is unwholeſome alone by it ſelf for an Engliſh man, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the contrary uſage, which is not concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant with nature: Water is cold, ſlow, and ſlack of digeſtion. The beſt Water is Rain Water, if ſo be that it is clean, and purely taken: Next to it is running water, the which doth ſwiftly run from the Eaſt into the Weſt upon ſtones or pibbles: the third Water to be praiſed, is Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver or Brook Water, which is clear running on pibbles and gravel.</p>
                     <p>Standing Waters, which are refreſhed with a freſh Spring, are good; but ſtanding Waters, and Well Waters, on which the ſun hath no reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, although they be lighter then other running Waters are, yet they are not commendable. And let every one beware of all Waters which are ſtanding, and putrefied with froath, docknet, and mud; for if they bake, or brew, or dreſs meat with it, it will ingender many infirmities. The Water which every man ought to dreſs his meat withal, or ſhall uſe baking or brewing, let it be running, and put it in veſſels, that it may ſtand there two or three hours, ſtrain the upper part through a thick linen cloth, and caſt the inferial part away. If any do uſe to drink water with wine, let it be purely ſtrained, and then ſeethe it, and after it is cold put it into his wine; but it is better to drink with wine ſtilled waters, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the water of Strawberries, of Bugloſs, of Borage, of Endive, of Succory, or the water of Sow-thiſtle, and Dandelion; and if any one is troubled with the Stone, or doth burn in the

Soft Cheeſe, not too new nor too old, is beſt; for in operation it is hot and moiſt. Hard Cheeſe is hot and dry, and ill to digeſt. Spermice is a Cheeſe, the which is made with Curds, and with the juyce of Herbs; to tell the nature of it is doubtful, conſidering that every Milk-wife may put many juyces of Herbs of ſundry operation and vertue, one not agreeing with another.

This diſeaſe, if it be great, is hard to be cured; if the Patient do eſcape death, he either falls into a Palſie of ſome part, or of the whole body. The Air the ſick perſon lives in muſt be ſomewhat hot, his Diet muſt be temperate; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Exerciſe, ſtrong Fractions and Ligatures of the extream parts may be uſed; Cupping-glaſſes muſt be faſtened to the ſhoulders: he

The Womb is chiefly affected through menſtruous blood, or ſome other humor, for the moſt part queazineſs of ſtomach, and loathng of meat, and thick breathing follow this diſeaſe.

The womb is the part chiefly affected, ſometimes the whole body ſympathizeth: this affection is an accident which appertains to the immoderate excretion; it is not altogether againſt nature, as it is in the bleeding of the noſe, and other bleedings; for here onely too great a quantity of the monethly flux is unnatural. This diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per takes away the appetite, hinders digeſtion, breeds crudities, weakens the whole body; the colour of the face is changed, feaveriſh heats a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe in the body; ſometimes the feet are ſwelled, and a dropſie follows: one cauſe is by reaſon of the heat, thinneſs, or abundance of blood more then is requiſite; or elſe becauſe of the continual motion, for when theſe concur, Nature is defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

                     <p>THe Obſtruction of the Liver is a binding or ſtraitning of the Veins, or Liver paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. The Liver is the Store-houſe of blood, from which all parts of the body draw nouriſhment; and together with purer blood, groſs and ſlimy humors are generated in the Liver, ſeeing that the branches of the hollow Veins are knit unto the <hi>Vena Porta</hi> in ſuch ſort, that the knitting and combination doth not come within the compaſs of our ſight, as alſo that all the nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the body muſt be conveighed through the port Veins, and the hollow Veins ends, which are very ſmall, where they end in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſubſtance: ſo that it is no wonder, that by reaſon of the paſſages and ſtraitneſs, Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are oftner cauſed in the Liver, then in any other Bowel. This Diſeaſe doth breed in the extream parts of the veſſels of the hollow part and Veins, and they are terminated in the Livers ſubſtance, with thin ends knit one into another with little bones, the univerſal nouriſhment of the whole body being to be made through theſe. This Diſeaſe is to be diſcerned by a heavineſs and ſtretching pain in the right ſide; then moſt to be perceived, when the Patient is exerciſed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after meat. The narrowneſs of the Liver, and Veins paſſages, is the cauſe of this Diſeaſe. The air for the Patient muſt be hot and clear; his diet ſuch as may heat, not ſtopping; he muſt ſhun bathing and exerciſe after meat, his diet
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:51945:203"/> moderate; he may ſleep in the day time, but not too long at night, not at the moſt above ſeven hours; his belly muſt be kept looſe, and his minde delighted.</p>

This Diſeaſe comes often for the moſt part by fits, as the Cough doth with a ſwooning; the cauſe of the ſwooning in this diſeaſe, is the ſtraitneſs of the paſſage of the air, which is contained in the ſtomach, it being often cauſed by fulneſs and ſuperfluous moiſture, by which the Patient is either loaded <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="362" facs="tcp:51945:209"/> over all the Membrane from the corners of the eyes. This evil takes its beginning from the <hi>Pericranium,</hi> from whence Veins are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed to the eyes through the forehead and temples. The part affected is chiefly the eye, where redneſs appears, and it is oftentimes ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, ſo that the Tunicles and parts near adjoyning are ſore ſtretched; this is either cauſed by the fulneſs of blood, by which the Membrane growing next to the eye is filled, or ſtretcht; or elſe by phlegmatick blood, and then it is not ſo ſtretcht; or elſe by thin ſharp Choller, running from the temple and corner veins ſecretly into the eye-veins, then ſuch tears guſh out of the eyes, that the next parts ſeem burnt, the <hi>Pupilla</hi> is in danger of being exulcera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if the tears that flow from the eyes are ſalt and hot. The Patients air muſt be dry, cold, and obſcure, his meat ſomewhat cooling, and little nouriſhing; he muſt eat little in the firſt dayes of his cure, his ſleep muſt be long, his belly evacuated, and his minde kept pleaſant.</p>

                     <p>THe Night-Mare called <hi>Incubus,</hi> is a Diſeaſe in which one doth think that a great weight lies on him in his ſleep; it differs from the Falling-ſickneſs, as the cauſe of it is veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, ſo is not the Hag or Night-Mare, there being no Convulſion, as in the Falling-ſickneſs. The part affected is the Heart-walls, or part of the Midriff; the ſenſe of the Patient in his ſleep is ſtupified; he ſuppoſes himſelf to be ſtifled,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:51945:209"/> inſomuch that he cannot ſpeak a word; he groans, and his fancy is ſo diſturbed, that he thinks a Spirit is there, whence the anguiſh of his minde is cauſed, ſo that he deſires to cry out, but cannot: from hence is cauſed the heating, or rather boiling of his blood, ſo that his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits being attenuated, and his pores opened, the Patient ſuddenly ſtarteth up. This Diſeaſe is cauſed from groſs cold Phlegm, as alſo from me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanchollick blood ſettled about the Heart and Veins of the Breaſt, from whence cold vapors are belched out. He that uſeth a ſlender diet, is ſeldom troubled with the Night-Mare, but doth frequent thoſe that have many crudities. They that lie on their ſides are very ſeldom troubled with it.

The Brain is firſt affected, and chiefly, and then the face with the whole body is taken with a Convulſion, which doth happen to thoſe that have the Falling-ſickneſs; in which accident, the roots of the Sinnews are hurt, the brain being ſhrunk, doth joyn all its force together for the expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of that which is hurtful. The brain is ſometimes firſt affected, and then the face with the whole body is ſhrunk up together; but for the moſt part a Convulſion doth happen to the Muſcles in determinate parts, whereby the part affected doth plainly ſhew that the Muſcles are grieved. The ſigns of this Diſeaſe are the ſtretching of the Sinnews, which if long with the Patient, do exceedingly waſte the ſtrength, while all parts under the head are annulled. The efficient cauſe is either fulneſs or emptineſs, ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is cauſed by blood, and then a Convulſion happeneth ſuddenly; it is alſo cauſed by a phlegmy humor, which doth winde it ſelf, as the blood doth into the Sinnews and Muſcles: this cauſes a Palſie. The emptineſs of a Sinnew takes more deliberation in growing upon a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient; this is occaſioned by the Ague, Hunger, Melancholly, violent Sweating, Vomiting, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Venery, or Inflamations in the ſinnewy parts.

Contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, the motive dies, when as the ſenſitive is found ſound: ſometimes it happens that ſenſe or motion is not quite taken away, but onely was dull, and is benummed. Phyſicians call this an imperfect Palſie, the Harbenger of a Palſie; why the ſenſe doth ſometimes periſh, and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on abides, this happens becauſe ſome parts do participate of a two-fold kinde of Sinnews: this Diſeaſe hath great affinity with the Apoplexy, and ſometimes is cauſed by a weak Apoplexy, and then it is called <hi>Paraplexia:</hi> herein they differ, the Apoplexy ſeizeth upon all the parts of the body, depriving them both of ſenſe and motion. The Palſie ſeldom or never leaves the head without motion or ſenſe, but the other parts of the body loſe both motion and ſenſe, and that in a different manner; for if the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the marrow of the Back-bone be affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, all parts under the face do ſympathize with it; if but one half of the back be affected, all parts that have relation alſo ſuffer: but if the before-mentioned parts are not hurt, but ſome particular Sinnew of ſome part of the body is looſed, that part whereof this nerve is joyned, ſhall alſo loſe ſenſe and motion. In this diſeaſe, as hath already been ſaid, the marrow of the Back-bone is affected, which is the original of all other Sinnews; wherefore the Practitioner ought to take pains in Anatomy, to know where this miſchief keeps its firſt reſidence. One evident ſign in this Diſeaſe is, that if the palſied part be

There are three kindes of Dropſies, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſarca,</hi> which is a diſperſing of Phlegmy humors over the whole body. In this Diſeaſe the body increaſeth moſt unnaturally, for it is all over
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:51945:225"/> ſwelled, and an humor mixed with Phlegmy Blood is ſpread over all the body between the skin and the fleſh, and the body doth ſuck it up, even as a ſponge ſucks up water, and by reaſon of this an ill colour paſſes over the whole body. The ſecond ſort of Dropſie called <hi>Aſcites,</hi> is that when great ſtore of windes, but greater of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, are gathered together in one place, which doth lie between the Guts and the Stomach. In this Diſeaſe, firſt the belly and <hi>Abdomen,</hi> by little and little, then the Thighs are ſwelled, and all the other parts of the body by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle wax lean; but when there is a greater ſtore of winde then water, whereby the <hi>Abdomen</hi> is ſtretcht beyond meaſure, called Timpanites; then rather a noiſe of winde then water is perceived, if the belly be ſtrook, for there is the ſound of a Tabor, from whence this Diſeaſe hath its name. The natural colour of the face in this Diſeaſe is not altered the Liver is the part affected, for hereby the blood is generated, and from this the Dropſie is cauſed by the primary affect of the Liver, and then the Cough comes withal, becauſe the hugeneſs of the Liver cauſeth the obſtructions of the Lungs, alſo the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements are not very liquid. Sometimes this Diſeaſe is cauſed by the conſent of the Miſente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Spleen, Stomach, Meſeraick Veins, and <hi>Jejunium inteſtinum,</hi> whereof a weakneſs of ſuch Veins doth follow, as did convey food to the Liver, and then Excrements are heaped toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the lower parts, untill they are corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo ſurcharge the body, and afflict the
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:51945:226"/> Patient with a Lax. The Patient in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, is for the moſt part troubled with a Feaver, and doth thirſt very much, eſpecially if he be troubled with <hi>Aſcites,</hi> and becauſe of Salt and putrefied humors, he loaths meat. The colour of the face is whitiſh, hardneſs of breathing, and heavineſs of the body, concurs alſo Swellings of the Feet, becauſe of the far diſtance of the heart. In <hi>Anaſarca</hi> the whole body is weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and doth Faint, and Swell equally, yet for the moſt part the Swelling is in the Shins and the Feet; ſo that if the Fingers are thruſt into the fleſh, the prints of them will remain a long time. The great coolings of the Veins and Liver is the cauſe of this long &amp; ſore diſeaſe; this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to the Liver by it ſelf, or elſe by the coldneſs of the Spleen, Guts, Miſentery, Midriff, which ſometimes becauſe of their obſtruction, ſomtimes becauſe of their weakneſs, draw not unto them too much blood; alſo it is cauſed by the Bleeding at the Noſe, by immoderate running, or by ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the monethly Courſes, or Hemrhoids, for ſo the natural heat is choaked by the loſs of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in the blood: ſometimes it is cauſed by the Flux of the belly, or ſtomach if they do laſt long, for the natural ſpirits, and native heat are ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. There are many other cauſes, if ulcers ariſe in the body by water, that is between the fleſh, becauſe of the great plenty of humor it is hardly cured. He who is ſupurated, or have a Dropſie, when he is cut or burnt, if that water or matter doth run out he dies preſently; alſo if a Cough doth ſeize on him he is in great danger. Of all
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:51945:226"/> theſe Dropſies the Timpanites is the worſt. He that is in a conſumption, many times fall into a Dropſie, becauſe the evil is communicated to the Liver, for matter and venomous filth having found a way into the Liver, gets in and ſticks faſt therein, and ſo doth corrupt the ſubſtance of it. The air where the Patient lives ſhould be clear and ſomewhat inclining to heat and drineſs; moiſt and windy air do increaſe this Diſeaſe. In this diſtemper a ſupper of roaſt meat is better then ſod; his meat muſt be eaſie of concoction: fleſh broth muſt not be given except the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent takes Purges; he may drink thin Wine, but not ſweet, becauſe this will not quench his thirſt; as it is good in this Diſeaſe to indure hunger, ſo to thirſt long is dangerous: mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate exerciſe, frictions, and the Baths are good; he may ſleep in the night time but not much, the Excrements muſt be anſwerable to nature, he muſt abſtain from Venery; and even as fear and ſadneſs do hurt very much, becauſe they hinder digeſtion, ſo anger and ſome of the other paſſions will be very good for him.</p>

                     <head>Of ſpitting of Blood.</head>
                     <p>SPitting of Blood is any avoiding of Blood at the mouth. Blood is alſo voided from many other places of the body; here care ought to be had in obſerving whether the Patient was wont to Bleed at the Noſe or no, for from thence it doth fall into the Stomach and Throat, and from thence into the Lungs, but for the moſt part it doth turn and harden into a cold; if
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:51945:227"/> then one ſpit blood and yet did not Bleed at the Noſe formerly, then it comes from ſome pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar part; blood is often voided from the Gums and Mouth it ſelf, and then the Spittle is of a bloody colour, and very little is voided out, and that without a Cough; if it do come from the Throat or Weezel-pipe, then it is voided by Hemmings not by Cough, and the continuated parts of theſe places do appear looſened, if the Tongue be thruſt out; but if it did come from the Head, a pain of the Head and heavineſs went before, a noiſe in the Ears, the Forehead Veins riſe, they have a kinde of a heat and blood in the Mouth, and a tickling is felt in the Palate, if it doth run into the Throat, from whence by often Hemming it is caſt out; oftentimes the Patient hath a deſire to Cough but cannot; but if the blood doth come from the Lungs, then is the blood foamy, and then it is voided by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Coughing and without pain, and at ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry times, and as oft as blood is voided, becauſe ſome great Vein is burſt, then plenty of blood is caſt up; no cauſe except that known, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it were caſt up by Vomit; but if blood be caſt up becauſe ſome Vein in the Lungs is gnawn, which is oft cauſed by a ſharp humor falling down, then it is voided by degrees, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle now, and a little then, unleſs ſome great Vein be fretted aſunder, for then it runs out in great abundance; for this is very dangerous, for then follows a Cough or a Feaver; ſometimes ſome part of the Lungs being rotted, is voided by a Cough, and this is the ſureſt ſign of the Lungs
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:51945:227"/> exulceration: much more might be written of the peculiar parts affected, and of the ſigns. This diſtemper is often cauſed by fulneſs, and by a great quantity of blood, which doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the body, and ſome peculiar parts of the body more particularly, ſo that hereby the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels mouths are opened. Of this is a good habit of body, immoderate uſe of hot nutriments and Wine, ſuppreſſion of tearms; and then there is no pain but rather a lightſomneſs of the body, which before was dull; and then alſo there is not too great a quantity thereof, and it is not very foamy or red. Women without any danger of Conſumption have been eaſed by this ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of blood in the ſuppreſſion of their tearms. To omit other cauſes that might be rendred of this diſtemper, it will be very neceſſary to take notice, that if the Lungs are ulcerated, there is danger, for then there is danger of a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puration and Conſumption when a Vein in the Lungs is opened and burſt; yet there is ſome hope, if the ſubſtance of the Lungs be ſound; yet a Conſumption ſignifies danger, if the blood which comes out of the rupture of a vein falling upon the Lungs be there detained, by which means the Lungs are inflamed and putrefied; for at length the ſubſtance of the Lungs will be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and putrefied; there is alſo danger when a great V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap> is opened or broke, for that the heart may be ſuffocated from the plenty of blood voided from thence. Spitting of blood, if it be cauſed by a corroſion of the Lungs, is incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

The air the Patient lives in ſhould be ſomewhat inclining to cold and dry, the Patient muſt avoid ſun-ſhine, and a bright fire, his meat muſt be ſuch as doth cool, dry, and binde, it ought to be of a ſlimy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; he muſt eat ſparingly, he may drink wine and water mixed together; he muſt ſhun all exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, he muſt breath very gently, for violent breathing is offenſive; he muſt not ſleep in the day time, his ſleep at night muſt be moderate; his belly muſt be kept looſe by art or nature, perturbations of his minde muſt be avoided, eſpecially anger.</p>

                        <hi>Chap. 9.</hi> Of the Quinteſſence of every Simple Matter.</head>
                     <p>WE are in the firſt place to learn what is the Quinteſſence of every thing, or ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple matter; which being known, the other ſecrets of this Art will more eaſily manifeſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto us: for every thing which hath its inſtitution from another thing, ought to have its definition declared, that the original may be underſtood. Know therefore that Quinteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is the fifth part of every thing, having forme and ſubſtance, and a moſt ſubtil ſpirit
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:51945:235"/> drawn from its body, as from a more groſs and craſſe matter, and ſuperfluity of four Elements, by a moſt ſubtil and extream diſtillation, as we ſhall hereafter teach.</p>
                     <p>But let it not ſeem wonderfull to any one that this Art hath for the moſt part lien ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſconded, and ſhut up from the common know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and vulgar capacities of men; for many of the Ancient Philoſophers have ſo laboured in this art, that thereby they have nouriſhed and preſerved the life of man to an extream old age; and have ſpun out the thread of life to the end of nature, and ultimate time ordained and appointed by God, <hi>Qui ſtatuit omnibus ſemel mori,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But as by a corruptible Medicine, life cannot alwayes be preſerved incorrupted; ſo a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine having neer affinity to incorruption, may preſerve the power of nature to an extream old age.</p>
                     <p>And the beſt Antidote conducing hereunto is the Quinteſſence, which is no elementary thing, but a certain ſecret ſoul drawn from its body; ſo that whatſoever it is admixed withal, ſeems in a manner incorruptible; for it comforts and reſtores all the powers and ſpirits of mans body, by the excrements of the Elements evacuated and waſted: and it is a ſpirit of life, for it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſteth all indigeſtible things, and cutteth away and digeſteth all ſuperfluous qualities.</p>
                     <p>For it preſerveth fleſh from corruption, it comforts the Elements, reſtoreth decayed Youth, vivifies the ſpirit, ſoft things it hardens,
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:51945:235"/> hard it mollifies, thick and groſs things it rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, thin ſubſtances it conduces and makes thick, the lean it makes fat, fatneſs it extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates; it cooleth the hot, and heateth the cold; drieth up moiſture, and moiſtneth drineſs; and repelleth every complexion adverſe to the body.</p>
                     <p>Further it extinguiſhes all the noxious matter of ſuperfluous humors, and reſtoreth natural heat; ſo that the greateſt Philoſophers never found out any thing more conducing to the ſuſtentation of life.</p>
                     <p>Now although the Quinteſſence may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times have the complexion of ſome other thing adjoyned unto it, (for unto what complexiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thing ſoever it be joyned, it draweth the complexion thereof unto it ſelf) yet ſolely by it ſelf, it hath none of the four qualities in it; to wit, Airy, Watry Fiery, nor Earthly, which could be diſcerned or diſcovered by the judicious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of the moſt skilfull Philoſophers. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know that the Quinteſſence hath not in it any thing of the earthly Element, Cold or Dry, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it cures melancholly diſeaſes which are cold and dry.</p>
                     <p>Therefore for a concluſion, obſerve that it is neither hot, nor cold, nor moiſt, nor dry; but is a thing of a temperate nature, exceeding all the Elements which are under Heaven: For when it is adminiſtred unto any one, it maketh that body temperate; neither doth it recede from its temporancy, by aſſuming any Qualities or Complexions.</p>
                     <p>Neither doth it follow, that it is a Medicine
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:51945:236"/> for cold infirmities, becauſe it is hot; nor that it cures hot diſeaſes, becauſe it is cold: for two contraries cannot exiſt in one body, becauſe one contrary is expelled by the other.</p>
                     <p>Therefore we ſee it ought not to be called hot or cold, nor dry or moiſt, becauſe it cures ſuch as are Phyſical, which are hot and dry; and the Hidropical, which are moiſt and cold; but all the four qualities are in it corrupted, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſublated.</p>
                     <p>And although it is not an Element, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it is a temperate Matter, purified by the Elements themſelves, and extracted from the Feces of the four Elements, which are the moſt powerful cauſes of the corruption.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Feces therefore are ſegregated as a moſt groſs body from its matter, as it were from a moſt ſubtil ſoul, by the Science and Art of diſtillations.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe the Quinteſſence is the <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne vocabulum</hi> of all things which have a form and ſpecies to extract it from; and although chiefly it is to be underſtood of Wine, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs there are very many other things from which it may be drawn and educed; as from all mettals, from all fruits, from fleſh, eggs, roots, and many other things as we ſhall ſhortly declare; and it excelleth all other things, becauſe of its great ſubtilty: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by very many Philoſophers it hath been called <hi>Coelum Philoſophorum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the Heaven is of it ſelf diſtinct towards the four Elements, ſo the <hi>Coelum Philoſophorum,</hi>

                     <p>The fourth degree of heat is ſo vehement, that it cannot be endured, becauſe it exceedeth in heat; and this degree is ebulition, or boyling.</p>

                     <p>And according to other Artiſts, the fire of a Bathe is the firſt degree, the fire of Aſhes the ſecond degree, and Sand the third; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times proceed to a fourth: but he who deſires to be a perfect Maſter in the Art of Diſtillation, ought to obſerve, that in all Diſtillations what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, the fire never ought to be increaſed to the fourth degree, becauſe the fire will be more violent then the nature of the matter to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled can bear. And by conſequence, Nature her ſelf will be violated through the violence of too much heat; and therefore of all Artiſts the fourth degree is to be rejected.</p>
                     <p>For Nature her ſelf was ſo ordained by God, that ſhe cannot ſuffer any violence or vehement thing, without the corruption of her ſelf, as by the judgement of many Philoſophers may be proved: Therefore I counſel all Lovers of this Art, that they do not undertake to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle with this excellent work given unto us by Divine Providence for the preſervation of our humane lives, unleſs they have the perfect knowledge of theſe four degrees of heat, and

                     <p>It is therefore to be underſtood, that the de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>grees of heat are alwayes to be diminiſhed afte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Whatſoever it is out of which you would extract a Quinteſſence by diſtillation, firſt of all let it be putrified and digeſted two moneths in Horſe-dung, and between the firſt and ſecond di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillation one moneth; between the ſecond and third, three weeks: between the third and fourth, fifteen dayes; between the fourth and fifth, eight dayes; between the fifth and ſixth, four dayes; and between the ſixth and ſeventh, two dayes.</p>
                     <p>And further obſerve, that the dung ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to be of the ſame equal heat; for if the heat be deficient, the circulation of the water is corrupted. And by conſeqence, the matter it ſelf which ſhould be reduced into the Quinteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, will be ſeparated in the heat of Heaven, as you may ſee in a Diameter Line, which divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the Quinteſſence, which is the ſuperiour part, from the feces, which is the inferiour part. And here note that theſe degrees of digeſtion and putrifaction of the matter is ſo to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed, as it is before declared concerning the degrees of heat.</p>
                     <p>Therefore there is required a longer time of putrifaction before diſtillation then afterwards; and when the firſt diſtillation is made, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contains not in it ſelf ſo much groſſneſs as before; and is become more apt to receive the Quinteſſence then before it was.</p>

                     <p>Or alſo digeſtion may be made in the winter time by ſetting the matter in a Vial, or Cucur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite, over a Furnace; or alſo the Cucurbite may be placed in a Veſſel full of ſand, and calefied with hot water; and let the Cucurbite be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in ſand two third parts, and ſet in the Sun in the Dog dayes.</p>
                     <p>I muſt here take the pains to explain what time of the year I mean by Dog dayes.

                     <p>You may likewiſe make digeſtion by putting your Veſſel in hot water, in the manner of <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neum Mariae.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is alſo another way, that is, that the Veſſel wherein you would digeſt your matter ſhould he placed in the Summer-time in an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets neſt, ſo that the bottom of the Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory may be almoſt buried, and that the Su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Laſtly the matter may be digeſted and putrefied in the moneth of <hi>October,</hi> or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, (when the Vintage is ripe in <hi>Vinacea,</hi> or in the mother of Wine, which hath no heat by accident, neither hath the Horſe-dung.</p>

                     <p>WHen you have digeſted Wine ſeven times over as before is directed, you may then thus prove, whether it be fit to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled.</p>
                     <p>Take a Linnen cloth and wet it in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted Wine, then kindle it with a candle, and if the Wine burn without leſion and combuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Linnen, it is not perfectly rectified; but it is a true ſign that there remains ſome wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſubſtance therein, and therefore the work is to be repeated; and it is to be digeſted ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and ſo long untill there remain no watry ſubſtance, which may be known by this proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as before is directed.</p>
                     <p>There are ſome who ſay it is to be proved by putting Sugar into the Wine; and if it be well rectified the Sugar will burn plainly with the Wine.</p>
                     <p>Now take notice that this digeſted Wine is not the Quinteſſence, but the ſubject of the Quinteſſence: but when the Linnen cloth burneth with it, and that it hath perfectly loſt its acute, ſulphureous, and unſavory taſte, and becomes pleaſant and ſweet to the taſte, and that no fumoſity remains in the aduſtion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; then you may call it a Quinteſſence. But in inſenſible things which have no ſapor, we muſt have reſpect unto the fume; as in Gold, and
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:51945:241"/> Silver, and other Mettals, and precious Stones; from which ſometimes is alſo extracted a Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſence, which is converted into <hi>Aurum potabile.</hi>

                     <p>The Circulatory Veſſels for diſtillation are of ſeveral formes according to the various opinions of Authors; there is a Circulatory called by ſome a <hi>Pellican,</hi> and of others, the Veſſel of <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes;</hi> this is the moſt noble and commodious for the work: others diſtill in a Cucurbite with an Alembick, with a blinde head; but of theſe every one may accomodate himſelf as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>

                     <p>WHen you perceive the matter by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent putrifaction to be ſufficiently digeſted, and that you have made experience thereof by the proof before directed, then have in readineſs your Veſſels fit for Circulation; include your matter in your Circulatory Veſſel, and put it in Horſe-dung, or ſet it in the Sun in the Dog-dayes, or in <hi>Balneo Mariae,</hi> calefied un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the firſt degree of heat, or a little more, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as you ſee the matter temperated and made ſubtil by digeſtion; and there let it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſo long time untill it be converted into your deſired Quinteſſence, which is to be known by the ſapor, as aforeſaid.</p>
                     <p>And obſerve diligently that if there appear in the bottom of the Veſſel any <hi>Hypoſteſis,</hi> that is a certain little troubled Cloud, that ought
<pb facs="tcp:51945:241"/> firſt to be ſeparated from its matter by diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which being done, Circulate it again as at firſt.</p>
                     <p>When therefore the diligent inquiſitor into this Art hath brought forth the Quinteſſence, in the putrification, and ſubtilty of the matter of Wine or fruits, let him confidently believe he may attain unto the ſame in all other things of the like nature. And therefore we muſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unto the opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that when a matter is thus by diſtillation nobilitated and made immaterial, it cannot be any more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to any form, being without any elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſubſtance, exceeding formality and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: and therefore it is as it were a Celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al body.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>NOn omnia poſſumus omnes;</hi> and as <hi>Heſiod</hi> ſaith, <hi>Non uni dat cuncta Deus;</hi> God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not the knowledge of all things to one particular perſon; neither is every one capable of underſtanding all Arts: but that every one
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:51945:242"/> may reap ſome benefit hereby; here follows an eaſie way of extracting the Quinteſſence of Wine without any great labour or coſt.</p>
                     <p>Take of the beſt Wine you can get, whether white or red, that which is a little ſweet, diſtill it in a Limbeck four times over, or oftner, till there remains no watry ſubſtance therein, which you may thus prove: put a little of it into a Silver or Braſs Veſſel, and kindle it with fire; if it burn up and leave no humidity in the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, it is diſtilled enough.</p>
                     <p>When this matter is thus digeſted and recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, put it in a Pellican, or a Veſſel called the Veſſel of <hi>Hermes,</hi> luted and cemented with ſtrong lute, ſo that the ſtrength of the matter cannot evaporate; but by the frequent aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and deſcention of the matter in the Veſſel it is converted into a pure Quinteſſence, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes from a corruptible matter, in a manner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible.</p>
                     <p>And when it hath many times been ſublimed after that manner in the ſaid diſtillatory, then open the mouth of the Pellican, and there will aſcend out a moſt precious and fragrant Odour, by which you may know whether there be any of the four Elements remaining in the matter which ought to be converted into the Quinteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. For if it be brought to a perfect Quinteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, there will ariſe out of the Circulatory a moſt fragrant and precious Odour, even of a celeſtial fragrancy and ſweetneſs. And if this fume enter into any ſecret place of the houſe it will fill the whole houſe with an admirable and
<pb facs="tcp:51945:242"/> moſt incredible ſavour, being of ſuch heavenly ſweetneſs and fragrancy: and if it be ſet on the top of any tower, <hi>Omnes Aves ad ſe attrahet quae circa ſunt in Viciniis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if when it is opened, it give not ſuch a ſcent, then cloſe again the mouth of the Pelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, and lute it well, and ſet it again to diſtil as before, until by that effect a perfect Quinteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence appears; or (as <hi>Raimund Lully, Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 2.) a vegetable Mercury, which you may alwayes know by its odour.</p>
                     <p>And it hath not onely an excellent odour and taſte, but is alſo incorruptible as to other Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, and doth not burn in the mouth as <hi>Aqua vitae;</hi> neither hath it any humidity or earthly ſubſtance, for all the terreſtrial and elementary matter remains in the bottom: And as the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it ſelf is compoſed of matter and form, ſo alſo is the Quinteſſence.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs it is not altogether free from corruption: for if it were perfectly incorru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible, it would make our bodies perpetual and eternal, which the Creator hath not permitted to the Creatures, ſince he hath meaſured out the term of our life, as ſaith the Pſalmographer: therefore when any matter is converted into a Quinteſſence, it is not become divine, but natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; nevertheleſs it is made by the divine help and aſſiſtance of God, without whom nothing is made.</p>

                     <p>WHen in this excellent Work you would avoid expence, and ſave that which is more precious, the loſs of time, and would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the Quinteſſence after this double way, you may do it without fire or coals.</p>
                     <p>The firſt way is this; Take Horſe-dung, and impoſe it in ſome large deep veſſel, or in a pit, as before is directed, made for this purpoſe; and in the middle of the dung place the diſtillatory impleted with the matter that is to be diſtilled, two thirds, and let the third part remain empty without the dung, becauſe nature requires it, that the matter may have its aſcent and deſcent, and may by conſequence be converted into a moſt clear water. And this is done without any labour or fire; but you ought once in a weak at leaſt to renew the dung.</p>
                     <p>It may be alſo done in the Sun in the <hi>Canicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,</hi> or Dog dayes, ſo that divine Providence hath provided that both rich and poor may have the operation of this Art.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:51945:243"/> its Etymology from the Greeks, <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſay, that <hi>Chelidonia</hi> takes it name from the greek word <hi>Celidon,</hi> which ſignifies a Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: for with this herb the Swallows help their young ones to their ſight in their neſts. And this herb flouriſhes at the coming of Swallows, and dies at their departure.</p>
                     <p>This herb hath innumerable vertues, and therefore I thought not fit to omit it in this work. The juyce of it being preſſed and ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, and gently boiled with Honey in a veſſel upon hot embers, is a ſingular remedy againſt all ſcales of the eyes. But to make the Quinteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence thereof, take of Celandine in the Summer time, when it is at its maturity and green, the whole ſubſtance, flower, herb, and root, what quantity you pleaſe, cut it ſmall, and beat it in a ſtone Mortar, then put it in an earthen Cucur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite well glazed, fill the Cucurbite quite full, lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it well, then ſet it in new Horſe-dung to ferment and digeſt by the ſpace of three weaks, then put it on an Alembick, and diſtil it in <hi>Balneo Mariae;</hi> let th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> to be ſomewhat moderate, and the Phlegme will come off, and the other Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will remain in the bottom of the diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory: then take out the Feces, and work them upon a Marble till you have made them as fine and ſubtle as poſſible: then put them again into the veſſel, and pour upon them the Phlegme which you firſt diſtilled off from them, and put them in a blinde Alembick, let them be very well luted, and ſet in <hi>Balneo Mariae</hi> ſeven or eight dayes to putrifie and digeſt: Or if you think
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:51945:244"/> that way too chargeable, ferment it in Horſe-dung: this being done, let the matter ſtand and cool a while, then diſtil it in aſhes in an Alim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck with a receiver, and there will ariſe a pure water of the colour of Oyl, which contains in it ſelf two Elements, to wit, the Air and Water: the other two, <hi>viz.</hi> the Fire and Earth reſiding in the bottom.</p>
                     <p>And if you would ſeparate the Phlegm from the Air, put the Oyl in a new diſtillatory, and diſtil it in <hi>Balneo Mariae</hi> with a gentle fire, and you ſhall ſee the Phlegme aſcend, and the Oyl will reſide in the diſtillatory; and thus you have theſe two Elements, the Air and Water ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated one from another: For the Oyl will not aſcend in <hi>Balneo,</hi> becauſe the fire is not powerful enough.</p>
                     <p>And when you would ſeperate the other two Elements, take the Feces out of which you have diſtilled the oyl, and bruiſe them upon a marble as at firſt; afterwards take four parts of Phlegm and one part of Feces, and incorporate them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then ſet them in a furnace in <hi>Balneo</hi> 7. days, and afterwards diſtil them in ſand with a ſtrong fire, and there will ariſe a red water: continue your diſtillation till it is converted into that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and you have in that water two Elements, <hi>viz.</hi> Fire and Water, and the Earth remains in the bottom of the Cucurbite, as a black mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; then put that red water in another Cucur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite, and diſtil it in <hi>Balneo Mariae,</hi> and the Phlegme will be ſeparated from it, and in the bottom of the Veſſel will remain a red Oyl,
